"body" : "The Overview feature is based around time. Sysdig Monitor polls the infrastructure data every 10 minutes and refreshes the metrics and events on the Overview page with the system health. You select how to view this gathered data by choosing a Preset interval and a time Range. Presets Presets are a way of visualizing data that Sysdig Monitor gathers every 10 minutes. Select a preset to determine the data sample to be displayed. Overview supports the following presets: 10 Minutes: Data polled for the last ten minutes. 1 Hour: Data polled for the last one hour. This is the default value. 6 Hour: Data polled for the last six hour. 1 Day: Data polled for the last day. Presets work in conjunction with Range selections. Selecting a particular preset interval refreshes Range selection and reloads the Overview rows and events subsequently. For example: 10 Minutes: Resets the Range to Jul 9, 2.20 pm - Jul 9, 2.30 pm. 6 Hour: Resets the Range to Jul 9, 8.30 am - Jul 9, 2.30 pm. 1 Day: Resets the Range to Jul 8, 2.30 pm - Jul 9, 2.30 pm. Because metrics and events are refreshed every 10 minutes on the Overview page, if you stay for more then 10 minutes on the Overview page, the data will be updated to show the newly-computed values. Presets are global throughout the Sysdig Monitor interface. For example, if you select 10 minutes in the Explore view, the Overview preset will also be 10 minutes, and vice versa. Choosing an unsupported Preset in Explorer falls back to 1 day in Overview. Range Range shows both date and time interval as well as the selected Presets in parenthesis. The Range indicated on the UI is determined by Presets. The time given is the closest time interval and by default, it is the current date and time preset by 1 hour. See Presets to understand how Range works with Presets. Time Format Overview supports UTC and PDT time formats. Use the toggle button next to Range to change the time format for the slot shown in Range. The default is PDT. Live The Live badge shows if the feed (Overview rows with data) is Live or Paused. Live: the data is continuously updating based on the 10-minute polling of the Sysdig back end. The Overview feed is normally always Live.

"body" : "Sysdig Monitor provides a wide range of functionality to allow users to work on individual levels, or within larger teams, by sharing data, dashboards, and configuration settings. Each component of Sysdig Monitor is affected differently. Explore Module The Explore module displays content on a per-user, per-team basis. The set of data visible within the Explore module will be restricted to the scope permitted by the team settings, even if a user belongs to other teams with wider scope permissions. Changes to the Explore table settings, for example, the order of columns, will persist only for the current user, and will not change the settings for other team members. Clicking individual rows in Explore takes you to the corresponding Dashboards view. The Dashboards view summarizes the health of the selected entity with respect to its resource consumption. Dashboards Module The Dashboards module displays content on a per-user, per-team basis. After switching to a new team for the first time, the initial settings will match those of existing team members. This means that, for example, the initial characteristics of each of the Dashboards Shared with Me will be the same as those of the owner of the dashboard. Consider the following guidelines while using Dashboards : Any dashboards created by a user while switched to a specific team will only be visible while the user is switched to that team. If the dashboard is shared, it will only be visible to members of that specific team. The set of data visible within a dashboard is restricted to that permitted by the scope settings of the team, even if the user belongs to other teams with wider scope permissions. Changes made to a shared dashboard will persist only for the current user, and not change the dashboard for other team members. Events Module Event data is specific to the active team. At a minimum, the custom events section will consist of events generated by an API token for a member of the active team. However, the team settings may also allow all custom events collected within the Sysdig Monitor environment to be visible to the team as well. Contact an admin user to review team settings. Alerts Module Alert settings are team-wide. Any team member can change the alert settings for a team, and those changes will be immediately visible to all other members of the team. Captures Module Captures can only be taken on hosts\/containers that are visible within the scope settings of the active team. The list of existing captures visible on the Captures module will also be limited to those initiated by team members while switched to the active team. API Token The Sysdig Monitor API Token is unique per team, to enable custom events generated via the API to target a specific team. Global Settings Some configuration settings are global across all teams. Changes to these settings by any user will affect all users, regardless of team status. These include notification channels, agent installation defaults, and Sysdig storage settings. " },

"body" : "Because custom metrics and their labels can grow to millions of entries, they are indexed by the system, and a \"metrics lifecycle\" is imposed both on them and their labels. This improves performance and prevents cluttering the system with a short-lived container or metric names. Sysdig Monitor maintains an index of all the custom metrics and the custom labels that have reported data in the last 14 days. Each indexed metric\/label is available when configuring new or existing artifacts, i.e. dashboards, scopes, alerts, and so on. When the system does not receive any data for a metric\/label for more than 14 days, or a metric\/label is found that has never reported data (for example, it was never added to the metric index), it is removed from the index if present, and marked as missing. Missing metrics are different from instances where a panel\/dashboard states that \"Metric data is not available\". A missing metric\/label is still available for data queries and charts. Existing artifacts are not affected. However, it is not possible to configure new artifacts with a missing metric\/label, or to update existing artifacts unless the missing metrics\/labels are removed from the configuration. If new data is received for a missing metric\/label, we put it back into the index and the above limitations are removed.

"body" : "Time aggregation comes into effect in two overlapping situations: Charts can only render a limited number of data points. To look at a wide range of data, Sysdig Monitor may need to aggregate granular data into larger samples for visualization. Sysdig Monitor rolls up historical data over time. Sysdig retains rollups based on each aggregation type, to allow users to choose which datapoints to utilize when evaluating older data. By default, Sysdig agents collect and report metrics at a 10 second resolution. For time series charts covering five minutes or less, datapoints are drawn at this 10 second resolution, and any time aggregation selections will have no effect. When an amount of time greater than five minutes is displayed, data points are drawn as an aggregate for an appropriate time interval. For example, for a chart covering one hour, each datapoint would reflect a one minute interval. At time intervals of one minute and above, charts can be configured to display different aggregates for the 10 second metrics used to calculate each datapoint. Aggregation Type Description average The average of the retrieved metric values across the time period. rate The average value of the metric across the time period evaluated. maximum The highest value during the time period evaluated. minimum The lowest value during the time period evaluated. sum The combined sum of the metric across the time period evaluated. In the example images below, the kubernetes.deployment.replicas.available metrics first uses the average for time aggregation: Then uses the sum for time aggregation: Rate and average are very similar and often provide the same result. However, the calculation of each is different. If time aggregation is set to one minute, the agent is supposed to retrieve six samples (one every 10 seconds). In some cases, samples may not be there, due to disconnections or other circumstances. For this example, four samples are available. If this was the case, the average would be calculated by dividing by four, while the rate would be calculated by dividing by six. Most metrics are sampled once for each time interval, resulting in average and rate returning the same value. However, there will be a distinction for any metrics not reported at every time interval. For example, some custom statsd metrics. Rate is currently referred to as timeAvg in the Sysdig Monitor API and advanced alerting language. By default, average is used when displaying data points for a time interval. " },

For example, three hosts report different CPU usage for one sample interval. The three values will be averaged, and reported on the chart as a single datapoint for that metric. There are several different types of group aggregation: Aggregation Type Description average The average value of the interval's samples. maximum The maximum value of the interval's samples. minimum The minimum value of the interval's samples. sum The combined value of all of the interval's samples. If a chart or alert is segmented, the group aggregation settings will be utilized for both aggregations across the whole group, and aggregation within each individual segmentation. For example, the image below shows a chart for CPU% across the infrastructure: When segmented by proc.name , the chart shows one CPU% line for each process: Each line provides the average value for every process with the same name.

The interface by default renders a selected host's top processes and their interaction with processes on remote hosts or host groups. Entities in any valid logical grouping can be visually represented with Topology View. The interaction is depicted as nodes and links. Links connect nodes. Nodes and links radially expand from the left. Nodes : The entities participating in network communication. A node could be a process, a container, a host, or any label identified by Sysdig Agent. For example: kubernetes.pod.name. Links : The network connection between nodes. Hosts and their child processes ( host.hostName > proc.name) serve as the default grouping for the Topology View. Scaling a Topology View is limited by the number of processes and connections. Sysdig Monitor creates the Topology View by identifying network endpoints (IP addresses) derived from system call data. Topology View in the Explore tab provides pre-defined dashboards to represent CPU Usage , Network Traffic , and Response Time metrics, and as such, they are not configurable.

Zoom into an entity by clicking the associated + icon and view the top processes within the selected entity. You can expand the hosts to see individual processes running inside and corresponding metric value. The links indicating network connections are rendered between entities in the selected hierarchy and, when zoomed, between processes and entities. Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom the content, then left-click and drag to move the map components within the window. Topology View uses legends and color schemes. This section explains what they mean. The line width (thickness) of the links expresses metric values relative to other connections in the system. Scaling line width is relative to the metric values associated with each link. Topology View dynamically adjusts the legend as the data recorded for each connection changes. The thin black line(—): Lower metric values. The thick black line( — ): Higher metric values. Dashed lines(---): A previously existed connection. For example, an active connection between node A and B, rendered as a solid line, could dissolve after a data update if that connection does not exist anymore in the new data set. Instead of removing it from the graph, Sysdig Monitor depicts the inactive connection as a dotted line until the next data update. If the connection returns in a subsequent data update, it is rendered again as a solid line. If the connection does not exist, the line will be removed. The color scheme is determined by color coding for the customizable threshold. The nodes are identified by five colors: Green indicates the node is healthy. Yellow indicates the node is in a warning state. Red indicates the node is in a critical state. Grey indicates the node state is unknown. An unknown node typically signifies a node where no Sysdig Agent installed. Light Blue indicates no threshold is defined for the metrics. " },

"body" : "The Kubernetes * Health dashboards break down resource and performance metrics by various logical entities to allow for an in-depth analysis, and for critical issues to be identified and isolated. Each dashboard is built around the Golden Signals approach to monitoring: Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation. Resource utilization metrics are oriented toward health and performance. These are aspects like CPU, memory, network, and storage usage by Kubernetes object. kube-state-metrics is about the status or count. Pairing kube-state-metrics with resource utilization metrics, each dashboard provides a comprehensive picture of what’s happening in your Kubernetes environment. Dashboard Description Use Cases Kubernetes Deployment Health Highlights whether each deployment has a sufficient number of available pods and resources, and indicates the number of pods running, desired, or have been updated. Identify performance bottlenecks. Locate logical entities that are consuming too many cluster resources, or that are rapidly trending upwards towards unsustainable levels. Dive deeper into specific entities to identify the root cause of problems. Use usage percentages over time to better estimate expansion capacity. For example: A deployment with no available pods indicates that the corresponding app is not serving requests. Getting a dashboard on this condition means you can visualize the metrics and spring into action to find and resolve the issue quickly. Dropping the number of pods available and remaining below the desired number indicate that your application performance is degraded or not running at the redundancy required. With these metrics represented on the dashboard, you get a quick glance of the severity of the impact on your app's user experience. A lower number of replicas running during an extended period of time than the number of replicas desired indicates a symptom of entities not working properly, such as nodes or resources unavailability, Kubernetes or Docker Engine failure, broken Docker images, and so on. No replicas for a deployment object could potentially mean that the app is down. A continuous loop of pod restart (CrashLoopBackOff) might be associated with missing dependencies or unmet requirements, or insufficient resources. In CrashLoopBackOff, pods never get into ready status and therefore are counted as unavailable and down. Kubernetes Namespace Health Displays metrics such as resource requests and resource limits at the namespace level; identifies the performance of the Kubernetes entities such as pods, deployments, DaemonSet, Statefulset, and jobs, and compliance with replicaSets specs. Highlights the number of services, deployments, replicaSets, and jobs per namespace. Kubernetes Nodes Health Highlights the number of nodes that are ready, unavailable, or out of disk; the number of nodes that are under the memory, disk, or network pressure; compares allocatable capacity with requested capacity on the node; provides the number of pod resources of a node that are available for scheduling and the available capacity to serve the pods running on the nodes. Kubernetes Pod Health Helps identify potential bottlenecks by graphing the number of container restarts, the number of pods waiting to be scheduled, resource utilization of containers within each pod and available capacity to serve pod requests, the number of available pods compared to the desired pods, and the number of pods in available state and ready to serve requests. Kubernetes replicaSet Health Provides details such as the number of pods per replicaSet, the desired number of pods per replicaSet, and pods per replicaSet that are in a ready state. Kubernetes Service Health Displays resource utilization of your services, container distribution, response time, and request count; provides details such as pod restarts and error count indicating potential performance issues. Kubernetes Health Overview Provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of the entire Kubernetes environment, broken down by various logical entities and underlying resource availability and usage. This dashboard breaks down resource and performance kube-state-metrics by the logical Kubernetes entities, such as pods, namespaces, deployments, and replicaSets, containers, and so on. Use these three dashboards to provide a high-level overview of all aspects of the Kubernetes environment's performance and resource saturation status. Set high-level alerts to narrow down areas of concern, before moving to the more in-depth dashboards. Quickly identify major performance issues within each type of entity. Kubernetes Cluster and Node Capacity Highlights a comprehensive overview of the performance of the hosts or nodes that form the Kubernetes cluster, including CPU, memory, and file system usage, and network traffic. Before analyzing the Dashboard, consider the following guidelines related to resource usage: If Resource Limits is undefined for a container, Kubernetes does not default to a value. if Resource Requests is unspecified for a container, Kubernetes defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Limits do not default to any value. If both Resource Limits and Resource Requests are not specified, no matter which value had been defaulted by Kubernetes, kube-state-metric (and hence Sysdig Monitor) reports zero. Therefore, only user-defined requested are reported by the kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte metric . The memory used by a container (the value returned by memory.used.bytes) can be greater than the memory requested by a pod (the value returned by kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte) . This is permissible in Kubernetes because Requests value determines the minimum amount of resources required. For these reasons, it can be deduced that In some cases, the value of Used Resources will be more than that of Resource Requests and Resource Limits, and the value of Resource RequestS could be more than that of Resource Limit. The value of kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte <= memory.used.bytes <= kubernetes.pod.resourceLimits.memByte " },

"body" : "Steps Description Decide What to monitor Determine what type of problem you want to be alerted on. See Alert Types to choose a type of problem. Define how it will be monitored Specify exactly what behavior triggers a violation. For example, Marathon App is down on the Kubernetes Cluster named Production for ten minutes. Decide Where to monitor Narrow down your environment to receive fine-tuned results. Use Scope to choose an entity that you want to keep a close watch on. Specify additional segments (entities) to give context to the problem. For example, in addition to specifying a Kubernetes cluster, add a namespace and deployment to refine your scope. Define when to notify Define the threshold and time window for assessing the alert condition. Single Alert fires an alert for your entire scope, while Multiple Alert fires if any or every segment breach the threshold at once. Multiple Alerts include all the segments you specified to uniquely identify the location and thus provides full qualification of where the problem occurred. The higher the number of segments the easier to uniquely identify the affected entities. A good analogy for multiple alerts is alerting on cities. For example, creating multiple alerts on San Francisco would trigger an alert which will include information such as the country that it is part of is the USA and the continent is North America. Trigger gives you control over how notifications are created. For example, you may want to receive a notification for every violation, or want only a single notification for a series of consecutive violations. Decide how notifications are sent Alert supports customizable notification channels, including email, mobile push notifications, OpsGenie, Slack, and more. To see supported services, see Notification channels . To create alerts, simply: Choose an Alert Type . Configure alert parameters . Configure the notification channels you want to use for alert notification. Sysdig sometimes deprecates outdated metrics. Alerts that use these metrics will not be modified or disabled, but will no longer be updated. See Heuristic and Deprecated Metrics . " },

Optionally, you can add a custom subject and body information into individual alert notifications. Enter Basic Alert Information Configuration slightly defers for each Alert type. See respective pages to learn more. This section covers general instructions to help you acquainted with and navigate the Alerts user interface. To configure an alert, Open the Alert Wizard and set the following parameters: (Setup): Type: Select the desired Alert Type . Each type has different parameters, but they follow the same pattern: Name: Specify a meaningful name that can uniquely represent the Alert that you are creating. For example, the entity that alert targets, such as Production Cluster Failed Scheduling pods . Description (optional): Briefly expand on the alert name or alert condition to give additional context for the recipient. Priority: High, Medium, Low, and Info are reflected in the Events list, where you can sort by the severity of the Event\/Alert. Parameters in Define , Notify , and Act sections (1) Define: Metric : Select a metric or entity that this alert will monitor. You also define how the data is aggregated, such as avg, max, min or sum. Metrics are applied to a group of items (group aggregation). To alert on multiple metrics using boolean logic, click Create multi-condition alerts . See Multi-Condition Alerts . Scope : Everywhere, or a more limited scope to filter a specific component of the infrastructure monitored, such as a Kubernetes deployment, a Sysdig Agent, or a specific service. Trigger : Boundaries for assessing the alert condition, and whether to send a single alert or multiple alerts. Supported time scales are minute , hour , or day . Single alert: Single Alert fires an alert for your entire scope. Multiple alerts: Multiple Alert fires if any or every segment breaches the threshold at once. Multiple alerts are triggered for each segment you specify. The specified segments will be represented in alerts. The higher the number of segments the easier to uniquely identify the affected entities. For detailed description, see respective sections on Alert Types. (2) Notify Notification Channel: Select from the configured notification channels in the list. Supported channels are: Email Slack Amazon SNS Topic Opsgenie Pagerduty VictorOps Webhook Notification Options: Set the time interval at which multiple alerts should be sent. Format Message: I f applicable, add message format details. See Customize Notifications . (3) Act (Optional): Configure a Sysdig capture. See also Captures . Sysdig capture files are not available for Event Alerts . Click Create or Save. Optional: Customize Notifications You can optionally customize individual notifications to provide context for the errors that triggered the alert. All the notification channels support this added contextual information and customization flexibility. Modify the subject, body, or both of the alert notification with the following: Plaintext: A custom message stating the problem. For example, Stalled Deployment. Hyperlink: For example, URL to a Dashboard. Dynamic Variable: For example, a hostname. Note the conventions: All variables that you insert must be enclosed in double curly braces, such as {{file_mount}} . Variables are case sensitive. The variables should correspond to the segment values you created the alert for. For example, if an alert is segmented by host.hostName and container.name , the corresponding variables will be {{host.hostName}} and {{container.name}} respectively, and no other segment variables are allowed in the notification subject and body. Notification subjects will not show up on the Event feed. Using a variable that is not a part of the segment will trigger an error. The segment variables used in an alert are turned to the current system values upon sending the alert. The body of the notification message contains a Default Alert Template. It is the default alert notification generated by Sysdig Monitor. You may add free text, variables, or hyperlinks before and after the template. You can send a customized alert notification to the following channels: Email Slack Amazon SNS Topic Opsgenie Pagerduty VictorOps Webhook " },

See also Captures . Sysdig capture files are not available for Event Alerts . Click Create or Save. You can also create alerts via the Sysdig API . Optional: Customize Notifications You can optionally customize individual notifications to provide context for the errors that triggered the alert. All the notification channels support this added contextual information and customization flexibility. Modify the subject, body, or both of the alert notification with the following: Plaintext: A custom message stating the problem. For example, Stalled Deployment. Hyperlink: For example, URL to a Dashboard. Dynamic Variable: For example, a hostname. Note the conventions: All variables that you insert must be enclosed in double curly braces, such as {{file_mount}} . Variables are case sensitive. The variables should correspond to the segment values you created the alert for. For example, if an alert is segmented by host.hostName and container.name , the corresponding variables will be {{host.hostName}} and {{container.name}} respectively, and no other segment variables are allowed in the notification subject and body. Notification subjects will not show up on the Event feed. Using a variable that is not a part of the segment will trigger an error.

"body" : "A rule is any type of activity that an enterprise would want to detect in its environment. Rules can be expressed in two formats: Falco rules syntax Basic rules syntax, grouped into five types: Container Image, File System, Network, Process, and Syscall. The Sysdig Secure UI groups rules into the different types and provides appropriate rule-creation entry screens for each type. (See also: Create a Rule .) Falco Rules See Using Falco within Sysdig Secure for a Falco overview. Note that Falco rules can be complex, and can be scaled to 100s of rules without impacting performance. \"Basic\" Rules Basic rules provide for simple detections of processes, network connections, and other operations. For example: If this process is detected, alert me. Or If a network connection on x port is detected, alert me. Unlike Falco rules, the basic rule types do not permit complex rule combinations, such as \"If a connection on x port from y IP address is detected...\" Basic rules can be scaled to 1000s of rules without impacting performance. The five categories of basic rules are described below. Container Rules These rules are used to notify if a specific image name is running in an environment. File System Rules These rules are used to notify if there is write activity to a specific directory\/file. <distinguish between read-only or read\/write. I.e. whitelist files> Network Rules These rules are used to: Detect activity on ports outside a trusted list on a specific list Notify in case of unexpected inbound\/outbound connections Process Rules These rules are used to detect if a specific process, such as ssh, is running in a particular area of the environment. Syscall Rules The syscall rule type is almost never deployed in user-created policies; the definitions below are for information only. These rules are used (internally) to: Notify if a specific syscall happens in a list Notify if a syscall outside this trusted list happens in the environment Understanding the Rules Library Organized by tags, where create new rules, can be referenced in policies. Using Falco within Sysdig Secure What is Falco Falco is an open-source intrusion detection and activity monitoring project. Designed by Sysdig, the project has been donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, where it continues to be developed and enhanced by the community. Sysdig Secure incorporates the Falco Rules Engine as part of its Policy and Compliance modules. Within the context of Sysdig Secure, most users will interact with Falco primarily through writing or customizing the rules deployed in the policies for their environment. Falco rules consist of a condition under which an alert should be generated and an output string to send with the alert. Conditions Falco rules use the Sysdig filtering syntax (documented here ). (Note that much of the rest of the Falco documentation describes installing and using it as a free-standing tool, which is not applicable to most Sysdig Secure users.) Rule conditions are typically made up of macros and lists. Macros are simply rule condition snippets that can be re-used inside rules and other macros, providing a way to factor out and name common patterns. Lists are (surprise!) lists of items that can be included in rules, macros, or other lists. Unlike rules\/macros, they can not be parsed as Sysdig filtering expressions. Behind the scenes, the falco_rules.yaml file contains the raw code for all the Falco rules in the environment, including Falco macros and lists. Anatomy of a Falco Rule All Falco rules include the following base parameters: rule name: default or user-assigned condition: the command-line collection of fields and arguments used to create the rule output: source: description: tags: for searching and sorting <priority?> Select a rule from the Rules Library to see or edit its underlying structure. The same structure applies when creating a new Falco rule and adding it to the library. Existing Rule Create a Rule <where's priority?> About Falco Macros Many of the Falco rules in the Rules Library contain Falco macros in their condition code. You can browse the Falco Macros list, examine a macro's underlying code, or create your own macro. To override the behavior of the default macros included in Sysdig Secure policies and rules, use the Rules Editor. About Falco Lists Default Falco lists are added to improve user experience around writing custom rules for the environment. For example the list allow.inbound.source.domains can be customized and easily referenced within any rule. (On-Prem Only) Upgrading Falco Rules with the Rules Installer Sysdig Secure SaaS is always using the most up-to-date Falco rules set. Sysdig Secure On-Prem accounts should upgrade their Falco rules set regularly. Rules Installer Use the Docker pull command and instructions on for the Rules Installer, here . " },

"body" : "For policy events local to the environment, the first step to address them is by adding custom Falco rules via the Rules Editor tab of the Policies module. These additions will extend or overwrite the behavior of a list, macro, or rule from the default rules section, in order to address the false positive. A number of rules have a macro with the prefix user_, that can be overridden in the custom rules section in order to change the behavior of a rule. Some examples include: user_known_write_etc_conditions user_read_sensitive_file_conditions user_known_change_thread_namespace_binaries user_shell_container_exclusions user_trusted_containers user_sensitive_mount_containers If a user_ macro is not available, Sysdig recommends appending changes to an existing list, macro, or rule, instead of overwriting them. Overwritten lists, macros, and rules will remain static when the default rules are updated. This could lead to new default rules being shadowed and inaccessible to the user. The specific changes necessary to the Falco rules depend heavily on the policy that triggered the false positives. A few examples are shown below: Write below etc For the Write Below etc policy, there may be an additional program that writes specific file(s) below \/etc (this example uses the program catsd , and the file \/etc\/catfood.cfg ). A macro could then be defined as follows: - macro: catsd_writing_catfood_cfg\n condition: (proc.name=catsd and fd.name=\/etc\/catfood.cfg) In addition, the macro user_known_write_etc_conditions would need to be overwritten to add a new exception: - macro: user_known_write_etc_conditions\n condition: catsd_writing_catfood_cfg Launch Privileged Container For the Launch Privileged Container policy, there may be a specific container that must run with privileges. The example macro below uses images starting with registry.customer.com\/mydatastore , and overrides the user_trusted_containers macro: - macro: user_trusted_containers\n condition: (container.image startswith registry.customer.com\/mydatastore) Run shelluntrusted For the Run shelluntrusted policy, a program may be present that spawns shells in the environment for legitimate purposes. The example below appends php to the list of known shell spawn binaries, using the user_known_shell_spawn_binaries list: - list: user_known_shell_spawn_binaries\n append: true\n items: [php] For more information on creating Falco rules, refer to the Falco Rules documentation.

"body" : "The example walkthrough below covers modifying a policy and the underlying rules to whitelist a container, in order to minimize false positive results. Identify the Container \/ Image to Whitelist The container\/image can be identified either from the Sysdig Secure UI (if an event has already been triggered), or directly from the host. From the Sysdig Secure UI To find the container \/ image: From the Policy Events module, use the left-hand drill-down menu to identify the object to whitelist. In this example, the desired object is one of the built-in Kubernetes components (k8s_kube-addon-manager): Using the drill-down menu is not strictly necessary, as all of the information is contained within the Policy Event Details window. However, using the drill-down menu can help verify the correct object to whitelist. Click on the relevant event to open the Policy Event Details window to review the event details, and identify the object to be whitelisted. In this example, the image is a sha256 digest as it is an internal component of Kubernetes, so the container name should be used instead, in case the component is upgraded at a later date. A variety of metadata can be used for whitelisting. For containers, container name, image name, or digest could be used. Container name is the most common approach, but this option could be spoofed. Image name (such as sysdig\/agent) is a more secure option. Using the digest is the most secure option as the source is guaranteed, but may require an automated solution to ensure the platform continues to whitelist the object correctly after component updates. Identify the name of the policy rule triggered by the object: From the Host CLI To find the container \/ image: In a terminal on the host, run the following command: The example command below limits the output of docker ps to only provide the relevant information, as it is only seeking the container name or source image. user@host:~$ docker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Image}}\" For larger lists, either use more|less or grep to find the specific object. In the example output below, grep is used to find addon , as the desired image is k8s_kube-addon-manager . The command also includes the table headings: user@host:~$ docker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Image}}\" | grep 'addon\\|NAME' | more\nNAMES IMAGE\nk8s_kube-addon-manager_kube-addon-manager-minikube_kube-system_8b52f08746ac78d32737b5f7fdffec52_3 9c16409588eb\nk8s_POD_kube-addon-manager-minikube_kube-system_8b52f08746ac78d32737b5f7fdffec52_3 k8s.gcr.io\/pause-amd64:3.1 Identify the policy rule violated. This can only be done via the Sysdig Secure UI. Add the Whitelist Rule The default Falco rules within Sysdig Secure are read-only. To modify a rule, rewrite it as a custom rule: From the Policies module, navigate to the Rules Editor tab. Define the macro by either creating a new macro, or editing an existing macro: This example edits an existing macro. The process is the same for creating a new macro, but requires a unique name. Find the existing macro in the Default Rules section, and copy it into the Custom Rules section Add a condition to the macro that defines the object to be whitelisted: Find the existing default rule, and determine if it uses the user_trusted containers macro: In this example, Write below root does not use the user_trusted_containers macro. Copy the rule to the Custom Rules section. Add the configured macro to the rule: Click the Save button to save the changes. The updated rule will be available the next time the Sysdig Agent checks into the back-end (usually every 10 seconds or so).

For example, for Azure Container Registry: Admin Account Username : in the 'az acr credentials show --name <registry name>' command result Password : The password or password2 value from the 'az acr credentials show' command result Service Principal Username : The service principal app id Password : The service principal password AWS ECR: AWS access key AWS secret key Google Container Registry: JSON Key (Primarily for OpenShift clusters): Add an internal registry address . The recommended way to run an image registry for an OpenShift cluster is to run it locally. The Sysdig agent will detect the internal registry names, but for the Anchore engine to pull and scan the image it needs access to the internal registry itself. Example: External name: mytestregistry.example.com Internal name: docker-registry.default.svc:5000 Sysdig maps the internal registry name to the external registry name, so the Runtime and Repository lists will show only the external names. Optional: Toggle the switch to Allow Self-Signed certificates. By default, the UI will only pull images from a TLS\/SSL-enabled registry. Toggle Allow Self-Signed to instruct the UI not to validate the certificate (if the registry is protected with a self-signed certificate or a cert from an unknown certificate authority). Optional: Toggle the Test Credentials switch to validate your entries. When enabled, Sysdig will attempt to pull the image using the entered credentials. If it succeeds, the registry will be saved. If it fails, you will receive an error and can correct the credentials or image details. If enabled, then enter the test registry path in the format : registry\/repo:tag E.g. quay.io\/sysdig\/agent:0.89 Click Save . " },

Wildcards are supported; an asterisk * specifies any repository. Tag : Any tag. Wildcards are supported; an asterisk * specifies any tag. Assigned Policy : Name of policy to use for evaluation. Select from the drop-down menu. Click Save . Optional: Reorganize the Priority order by clicking the drag handle (the four dots to the left of a line) and dragging the assignment to a different spot on the list. Using Priorities When you use more than one scanning policy, the Anchore engine evaluates them in top-down order, starting from Priority 1 in the Policy Assignment list. The first policy assignment rule that matches an input image will be evaluated, and all subsequent rules ignored. Therefore, the priority order is important. For example, imagine a list with two defined policy assignments: Priority 1 Registry = quay.io Repository = sysdig\/* Priority 2 Registry = quay.io Repository = sysdig\/myrepo Since the first rule uses a wild card, the evaluation applies to all repos beginning with sysdig\/ and will stop before evaluating sysdig\/myrepo . Reverse the priority order to get the behavior you want. There is a catch-all entry at the bottom of the Policy Assignment list that cannot be removed. It has the format : registry = * repository = * tag = * assigned policy = default (You can change the assigned policy , but other fields cannot be edited.) The purpose of this row is to ensure that any registries that do not fall under another policy evaluation will at least be evaluated against the system-configured Default policy.

Parameter Description Example user_names A comma-separated list of usernames to blacklist. daemon,ftp content_not_available The content_not_available trigger will trip if the \/etc\/passwd file is not present in the image. No parameters are required. Ruby Gems The Ruby Gems gate ensures that developers are using official packages from the official GEM database, and are not using versions of packages that are no longer supported. blacklist The blacklist trigger trips if a GEM package that matches the configured name and version is found in the evaluated image. Parameter Description Example name The name of the gem. time_diff version The version of the gem to blacklist. 0.2.9 feed_data_unavailable This trigger will trip if Sysdig does not have access to the GEM data feed. No parameters are required. newer_version_found_in_feed This trigger will trip if an installed GEM package is not the latest version. No parameters are required. not_found_in_feed This trigger will trip if an installed GEM is not in the official GEM database. No parameters are required. version_not_found_in_feed This trigger will trip if the GEM is not listed in the official GEM feed as a valid \/ supported version. No parameters are required. Secret Scans Secret scans determine, based on configured regex, whether secrets that could be available if an image was compromised have been baked into the image. content_regex_checks The content_regex_checks trigger trips if the content search analyzer finds a match with the configured and named regexes. Matches are filtered by the content_regex_name , and the filename_regex , if either are set. The content_regex_name should be a value from the secret_search section of analyzer_config.yaml . Parameter Description Example content_regex_name The name of the variable \/ content. If found in the image, this should trip the trigger. The names available by default are AWS_ACCESS_KEY , AWS_SECRET_KEY , PRIV_KEY , DOCKER_AUTH , and API_KEY . AWS_ACCESS_KEY filename_regex Filters the files that should be analyzed for the presence of the content_regex_name . \/etc\/.* Vulnerabilities CVE \/ vulnerability checks can be used to ensure the included packages don't have vulnerabilities above a set level, are older than a designated period, or if data is unavailable. package The package trigger is tripped if a vulnerability in an image matches the configured comparison criteria.

"body" : "Customize your view of the test report, e.g. to see only high-priority results or the results from selected controls.

Under Report on the Compliance Task page: Choose Custom Selection Choose a benchmark version and apply a Profile filter, and\/or select\/deselect individual controls. Use the information in this section to understand the effect of your selections. About Custom Selections Filtering rules apply to the report, not the test itself. Filtering Rules Filtering the Report view does not change the scope of the test run. The full compliance benchmark will be run, but the result view will be edited. If you apply a filter to an existing task which has already been run, the filter view will be retroactively applied to the historical reports. If you deselect the filter, the full results will again be visible. About Benchmark Versions CIS issues benchmark versions that correspond to – but are not identical with -- the Kubernetes or Docker software version. See the mapping tables, below. Version Rules If you do not customize\/filter your report, the Sysdig agent will auto-detect your environment version and will run the corresponding version of the benchmark controls. If you specify a benchmark version, you can then apply a report filter. If the test version doesn't match the environment version, the filter will be ignored and all the tests will be displayed.

In Sysdig Secure, full benchmarks are always run, but you can filter your view of the report to see only top-priority (Level 1 Profile) or only the secondary (Level 2 Priority) results. From the CIS FAQ : Level 1 Profile: Limited to major issues Considered a base recommendation that can be implemented fairly promptly and is designed to not have an extensive performance impact. The intent of the Level 1 profile benchmark is to lower the attack surface of your organization while keeping machines usable and not hindering business functionality. Level 2 Profile: Extensive checks, more complete Considered to be \"defense in depth\" and is intended for environments where security is paramount. The recommendations associated with the Level 2 profile can have an adverse effect on your organization if not implemented appropriately or without due care. In the Sysdig Secure interface, select All to view an in-depth report that includes both Level 1 and Level 2 controls. Select Level 1 to view a report that includes only high-priority controls. Select Level 2 to view a report that includes only the lower-priority controls that are excluded from Level 1. See also: Configure Compliance Tasks . " },

"body" : "Linux Distributions A 64-bit Linux distribution with a minimum kernel version of 3.10, and support of docker-engine 1.7.1 or later, is required for each server instance. Recommended Linux distributions: RedHat, Ubuntu, Amazon AMI, Amazon Linux 2. Docker Requirements For the Docker installation, running devicemapper in 'loopback mode' is not supported . It has known performance problems and a different storage driver should be used. Please see this note from our Replicated infrastructure partner: devicemapper-installation-warning . Installing the latest version of Docker is recommended. Cassandra Cassandra is used as the metrics store for Sysdig agents. It is the most dynamic component of the system, and requires additional attention to ensure that your system is performing well and highly responsive. This component is stateful, and should be treated more carefully than stateless components. Cassandra sizing is based on a minimum replication factor as well as the number of agents writing data. A minimum replication factor of 3 is recommended for the Sysdig application, which allows the cluster to survive the failure of 1 Cassandra instance. Each agent consumes anywhere from 500MB to 2GB of Cassandra storage, with average sizing at 1.5GB\/agent. Because of Sysdig's data aggregation model, this storage should comfortably handle multi-year history. This needs to then be multiplied by the replication factor to determine the total disk space required. A rough calculation might be: 100 agents = 150GB raw, X replication factor of 3, = 450GB total To be safe we recommend that you size some additional disk space as buffer (say 25-50%) on top of that. Network Configuration The following firewall\/security configurations are required for inbound and outbound traffic for the Sysdig platform: Ports Port State Direction Description 6666 Open (optional) Inbound Agent communication (unencrypted) 6443 Open Inbound Agent Communication (TLS\/encrypted) 443 Open Inbound Sysdig Monitor user-interface access inbound 443* Open Outbound *Optional, used if collecting AWS CloudWatch metrics. See also AWS: Integrate AWS Account and CloudWatch Metrics (Optional) . 443* Open Outbound *Optional, needed if using Sysdig Secure Image Scanning to download vulnerability definitions. Must be open to Cloudflare IP ranges: https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/ips\/ . 8800 Open Inbound Replicated Management Console access (for on-premises installations that don't use Kubernetes) Warning: Port 6666 should only be opened if agents will be communicating with the collectors without encryption. Additional ports may need to be configured for the Replicated infrastructure manager. Refer to the Replicated port requirements documentation for more information. HTTP\/HTTPS and Proxy Support All non-airgapped hosts require outbound HTTP\/S internet access for: License validation Pulling Sysdig\/Agent containers from the Docker hub repository Release update checks Note: Sysdig does not support HTTP\/S proxies for Sysdig platform components. Summary: Plan Proxy Support for Notification Channels, CloudWatch Metrics, Capture Storage In release #760 and newer of the Sysdig platform back-end, an option is available to configure outgoing HTTP\/HTTPS connections to be made via proxy. This has been tested and supports outgoing web connections that are necessary to support the following features: Notification Channels PagerDuty Slack Amazon SNS VictorOps OpsGenie WebHook Gathering of AWS CloudWatch data Capture storage to an AWS S3 bucket Proxied web connectivity to support authentication mechanisms (SAML. OpenID Connect, OAuth) are not supported at this time. Configure Proxy Using JVM Options The proxy settings are configured via the JVM options passed to the Sysdig software components. JVM options can be added\/appended at any time (with a required restart). In a Replicated on-premises install , use the Advanced Settings panel to enter JVM options in the Sysdig application JVM options field. (See \"Define Advanced Settings\" on Install Using the Replicated GUI .) If JVM settings have already been set, log in to the Replicated Management console and choose the Settings tab. At the bottom of the screen, check the box to Show Advanced Settings to reveal the configuration option. In a Kubernetes-based on-premises install , set the sysdigcloud.jvm.options in the config.yaml used to set the ConfigMap: # Optional: Sysdig Cloud application JVM options. For heavy load environments you'll need to tweak \n# the memory or garbage collection settings\n sysdigcloud.jvm.options: \"\" Enter the proxy parameters, as in the example below. This JVM options string will forward all HTTP and HTTPS traffic via outgoing port 8888 on a proxy at hostname proxy.example.com . IP address may be specified instead of hostname. -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.example.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8888 -Dhttps.proxyPort=8888 -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.example.com Exclusions Do not use local host or 127.0.0.1. By default, HTTP\/HTTPS requests to localhost or 127.0.0.1 will not be directed by the back-end toward any configured proxy, which is necessary for the functioning of some web components internal to the Sysdig platform containers. If you deploy the Sysdig platform in AWS, add an additional proxy parameter -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=169.254.169.254 Rational: This provides a work-around for the backend occasionally making HTTP requests to a special instance metadata address 169.254.169.254, which is undesirable when using a proxy. This IP address will be excluded from proxying by default in a future release. If you have additional proxy exclusions you wish to specify that are unique to your environment, these can also be added using the pipe separator. For example, assume your deployment was in AWS and you also had a webhook target 192.168.1.2 that was not reachable via your proxy.To exclude both: Replicated: your complete string to enter into the console for Sysdig application JVM options would be: -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.example.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8888 -Dhttps.proxyPort=8888 -Dhttps.proxyHost=proxy.example.com -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=169.254.169.254|192.168.1.2 Kubernetes: when setting the sysdigcloud.jvm.api.options and sysdigcloud.jvm.worker.options in the config.yaml for the ConfigMap, the pipe separator must be double-escaped, such as: # Optional: Sysdig Cloud application JVM options. For heavy load environments you'll need to tweak \n# the memory or garbage collection settings\n sysdigcloud.jvm.api.options: \"-Xms2048m -Xmx2048m -Dhttp.proxyHost=xxx.xxx.sysdig.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=80 -Dhttps.proxyPort=80 -Dhttps.proxyHost=xx.xx.sysdig.com -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=169.123.169.123\\\\|127.0.0.1\\\\|localhost\\\\|.sysdig.com\" Time Synchronization The Sysdig platform requires the system clocks to be closely synchronized between hosts. When provisioning hosts for installation, ensure the system clocks are synchronized. Recommended: Install NTP to ensure all host clocks stay synchronized. " },

Two items from your Sysdig purchase-confirmation email: Your Sysdig license key Your Sysdig quay.io pull secret kubectl installed on your machine and communicating with the Kubernetes cluster (Note that your kubectl and Kubernetes versions should match to avoid errors.) An External Load Balancer (required for production – see below) If installing in a cloud-provider environment (such as AWS, GCloud, or Azure), you will deploy an HAProxy load balancer and point a DNS record to that load balancer. If installing in your own data center, then you will need two DNS records, one for the collector and one for the UI. A DNS server and control over a DNS name that you can point to Sysdig Add External Load Balancer Create a TCP load balancer (i.e., AWS NLB) that forwards ports 80, 443, 6443 to the Kubernetes worker nodes, with a healthcheck to \/healthz on port 10253. This can be done in three ways: Use an existing external load balancer. Sysdig relies heavily on DNS; you need a DNS record pointing to the load balancer. Create a load balancer in your cloud provider. (For example in AWS, see https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/AmazonECS\/latest\/developerguide\/create-network-load-balancer.html .) You need a DNS record that points to the load balancer. This is the fully qualified domain name required later in the config.yaml, api-ingress.yaml and\/or api-ingress-with-secure.yaml . Create a yaml with the following content and apply it to the sysdigcloud namespace. This automatically creates a load balancer in the cloud provider environment, with an external DNS name. This is the fully qualified domain name required later in the config.yaml, api-ingress.yaml and\/or api-ingress-with-secure.yaml . ---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n name: haproxy-ingress-lb-service\nspec:\n type: LoadBalancer\n ports:\n - name: http\n port: 80\n targetPort: 80\n - name: https\n port: 443\n targetPort: 443\n - name: https2\n port: 6443\n targetPort: 6443\n selector:\n run: haproxy-ingress To get the DNS name, run the command: $ kubectl get svc -o wide -n sysdigcloud The output shows the External-IP (DNS name): NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE SELECTOR\nhaproxy-ingress-lb-service LoadBalancer 100.66.118.183 sample123.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com 80:31688\/TCP,443:32324\/TCP,6443:30668\/TCP 1d run=haproxy-ingress DNS Entry (For Test Environments without Load Balancer) Not for production environments. Create a DNS entry for your Sysdig install using the fully qualified domain name that contains all the external IPs as A records. This will use DNS round-robin to load balance your clients to the Kubernetes cluster. Prepare the Environment The install images, scripts, and other files are located in a GitHub repository: https:\/\/github.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes Step 1 Clone the Source Files into a New Namespace Sysdig provides the necessary scripts, images, and .yaml files in a GitHub repository. The first step is to clone those files and check out the latest version. (These examples use 1765.) Run the command: git clone https:\/\/github.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes.git\ncd sysdigcloud-kubernetes\ngit checkout tags\/v1765 Create a namespace called sysdigcloud : kubectl create namespace sysdigcloud Step 2 Configure Backend Components The ConfigMap ( config.yaml ) is populated with information about usernames, passwords, SSL certs, and various application-specific settings. The steps below give the minimum edits that should be performed in a test environment. It is necessary to review and customize the entries in config.yaml before launching in a production environment. See Making Configuration Changes for the kubectl format to use for post-install edits, such as adding third party authenticators like LDAP. Add your license key: In config.yaml, enter the key that was emailed to you in the following parameter: # Required: Sysdig Cloud license\n sysdigcloud.license: \" Change the super admin name and password, which are the super admin credentials for the entire system. See here for details. Find the settings in config.yaml here: sysdigcloud.default.user: test@sysdig.com\n # Required: Sysdig Cloud super admin user password\n # NOTE: Change upon first login\n sysdigcloud.default.user.password: test Edit the collector endpoint and api-url: Change the defaults ( sysdigcloud-collector and sysdigcloud-api:443) to point to the DNS name you have established for Sysdig. Note: The collector port should remain 6443. collector.endpoint: <DNS_NAME>\ncollector.port: \"6443\"\napi.url: https:\/\/<DNS_NAME>:443 Recommended: edit the file to set the JVM options for Cassandra, Elasticsearch, and API, worker, and collector as well. (To use the AWS implicit key, edit the JVM options as described in AWS: Integrate AWS Account and CloudWatch Metrics (Optional) .) For installations over 100 agents, it is recommended to allocate 8 GB per JVM. cassandra.jvm.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\"\n elasticsearch.jvm.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\"\n sysdigcloud.jvm.api.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\"\n sysdigcloud.jvm.worker.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\"\n sysdigcloud.jvm.collector.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\" Note: If you do not wish to use SSL between the agent and the collector, use the following settings instead: cassandra.jvm.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\"\nelasticsearch.jvm.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\"\nsysdigcloud.jvm.api.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G -Ddraios.agents.installParams.sslEnabled=false\"\nsysdigcloud.jvm.worker.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G -Ddraios.agents.installParams.sslEnabled=false\"\nsysdigcloud.jvm.collector.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G -Ddraios.agents.installParams.sslEnabled=false\" See also: Step 5 Set Up SSL Connectivity to the Backend . Deploy the configuration map and secrets for all services by running the commands: For Sysdig Monitor: kubectl -n sysdigcloud apply -f sysdigcloud\/config.yaml To add Sysdig Secure: kubectl -n sysdigcloud apply -f sysdigcloud\/scanning-secrets.yaml\nkubectl -n sysdigcloud apply -f sysdigcloud\/anchore-secrets.yaml Configure DNS name in api-ingress.yaml (or api-ingress-with-secure.yaml if using Secure). (Files located in sysdigcloud\/) Edit: host: <EXTERNAL-DNS-NAME> to suit your DNS name Define namespace in ingress-clusterrolebinding.yaml . (File located in sysdigcloud\/ingress_controller\/) Edit namespace: sysdigcloud Step 3 (Secure-Only): Edit mysql-deployment yaml If using Sysdig Secure : Edit the MySQL deployment to uncomment the MYSQL_EXTRADB_* environment variables. This forces mysql to create the necessary scanning database on startup. File location: datastores\/as_kubernetes_pods\/manifests\/mysql\/mysql-deployment.yaml - name: MYSQL_EXTRADB_SCANNING_DBNAME\n valueFrom:\n configMapKeyRef:\n name: sysdigcloud-config\n key: scanning.mysql.dbname\n - name: MYSQL_EXTRADB_SCANNING_USER\n valueFrom:\n configMapKeyRef:\n name: sysdigcloud-config\n key: scanning.mysql.user\n - name: MYSQL_EXTRADB_SCANNING_PASSWORD\n valueFrom:\n secretKeyRef:\n name: sysdigcloud-scanning\n key: scanning.mysql.password\n The scanning service will not start unless MySQL creates the scanning database. Step 4 Deploy Your Quay Pull Secret A specific Quay pull secret is sent via email with your license key. Edit the file sysdigcloud\/pull-secret.yaml and change the place holder <PULL_SECRET> with the provided pull secret. Deploy the pull secret object: kubectl -n sysdigcloud apply -f sysdigcloud\/pull-secret.yaml Step 5 Set Up SSL Connectivity to the Backend SSL-secured communication is used between user browsers and the Sysdig API server(s), and between the Sysdig agent and the collectors. To set this up, you must: Use existing standard certs for API and collector, or Create self-signed certificates and keys for API and collector To disable SSL between agent and collector: To disable SSL between agent and collectors, you set a JVM option when configuring backend components (see above). To create self-signed certs: Run these commands (edit to add your API_DNS_NAME and COLLECTOR_DNS_NAME ): openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3650 -nodes -x509 -subj \"\/C=US\/ST=CA\/L=SanFrancisco\/O=ICT\/CN=<API_DNS_NAME>\" -keyout server.key -out server.crt\nopenssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3650 -nodes -x509 -subj \"\/C=US\/ST=CA\/L=SanFrancisco\/O=ICT\/CN=<COLLECTOR_DNS_NAME>\" -keyout collector.key -out collector.crt To create Kubernetes secrets: Uses two different certificates, one for the API\/UI, and one for the collector. Run these commands: kubectl -n sysdigcloud create secret tls sysdigcloud-ssl-secret --cert=server.crt --key=server.key\nkubectl -n sysdigcloud create secret tls sysdigcloud-ssl-secret-collector --cert=collector.crt --key=collector.key Step 6 (Optional) Use CA Certs for External SSL Connections The Sysdig platform may sometimes open connections over SSL to certain external services, including: LDAP over SSL SAML over SSL OpenID Connect over SSL HTTPS Proxies If the signing authorities for the certificates presented by these services are not well-known to the Sysdig Platform (e.g., if you maintain your own Certificate Authority), they are not trusted by default. To allow the Sysdig platform to trust these certificates, use the command below to upload one or more PEM-format CA certificates. You must ensure you've uploaded all certificates in the CA approval chain to the root CA. kubectl -n sysdigcloud create secret generic sysdigcloud-java-certs --from-file=certs1.crt --from-file=certs2.crt " },

(Note that your oc and OpenShift versions should match to avoid errors.) DNS Preparation If you want more information on OpenShift's DNS requirements; see the OpenShift documentation . Option 1: DNS without Wildcard You need to request two different DNS records from your DNS team: one for the Sysdig API\/UI and another for the Sysdig collector. These records should point to your infrastructure nodes and are the two routes that will be exposed, i.e., sysdig.api.example.com and sysdig.collector.example.com . Option 2: DNS with Wildcard With wildcard DNS, you do not have to make an official request from the DNS team. Your implementation team can pick any two DNS names to use for the API\/UI and Collector. These will be exposed to the infrastructure nodes once the configuration is completed. (i.e. sysdig.api.example.com and sysdig.collector.example.com .) SSL Certificate Preparation Step 5 Set Up SSL Connectivity to the Backend discusses how to implement SSL; decide ahead of time whether you will use SSL with wildcard or without. SSL with Wildcard With wildcard SSL, you use the same certificate for both the API and the collector. SSL without Wildcard You need two SSL certs, one for each DNS record. Prepare the Environment Step 1 Download and Unpack the Latest Release Download the latest release from https:\/\/github.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes\/releases\/latest Unpack the .tar ball. The source link has the format: https:\/\/github.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes\/archive\/<v1234>.tar.gz. To unpack it, run the following commands (replacing version number as appropriate): wget https:\/\/github.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes\/archive\/<v1234>.tar.gz\ntar zxf <v1234>.tar.gz\ncd sysdigcloud-kubernetes-<1234> Create a new project called sysdigcloud and copy the cloned folders into it: oc new-project sysdigcloud Apply the correct security contexts to the namespace. (This allows you to run privileged containers in the sysdigcloud namespace) oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -n sysdigcloud -z default\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -n sysdigcloud -z default Step 2 Configure Backend Components The ConfigMap ( config.yaml ) is populated with information about usernames, passwords, SSL certs, and various application-specific settings. The steps below give the minimum edits that should be performed in a test environment. It is necessary to review and customize the entries in config.yaml before launching in a production environment. See Sysdig Install on OpenShift (v. 1929+)#Making Configuration Changes for the oc format to use for post-install edits, such as adding third-party authenticators like LDAP. Add your license key: In config.yaml, enter the key that was emailed to you in the following parameter: # Required: Sysdig Cloud license\n sysdigcloud.license: \"\" Change the super admin name and password, which are the super admin credentials for the entire system. See here for details. Find the settings in config.yaml here: sysdigcloud.default.user: test@sysdig.com\n # Required: Sysdig Cloud super admin user password\n # NOTE: Change upon first login\n sysdigcloud.default.user.password: test Edit the collector endpoint and API URL: Change the placeholder to point to the DNS names you have established for Sysdig. Remember that you must have defined one name for the collector and another for the API URL. See Sysdig Install on OpenShift (v. 1929+)#Prerequisites , above. Note: Change the collector port to 443. collector.endpoint: <COLLECTOR_DNS_NAME>\ncollector.port: \"443\"\napi.url: https:\/\/<API_DNS_NAME>:443 Recommended: edit the file to set the JVM options for Cassandra, Elasticsearch, and API, worker, and collector as well. (To use the AWS implicit key, edit the JVM options as described in AWS: Integrate AWS Account and CloudWatch Metrics (Optional) .) For installations over 100 agents, it is recommended to allocate 8 GB of heap per JVM. cassandra.jvm.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\"\n elasticsearch.jvm.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\"\n sysdigcloud.jvm.api.options: \"-Xms4G -Xmx8G\"\n sysdigcloud.jvm.worker.options: \"-Xms4G -Xmx8G\"\n sysdigcloud.jvm.collector.options: \"-Xms4G -Xmx8G\" Note: If you do not wish to use SSL between the agent and the collector, use the following settings instead: cassandra.jvm.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\"\nelasticsearch.jvm.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G\"\nsysdigcloud.jvm.api.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G -Ddraios.agents.installParams.sslEnabled=false\"\nsysdigcloud.jvm.worker.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G -Ddraios.agents.installParams.sslEnabled=false\"\nsysdigcloud.jvm.collector.options: \"-Xms8G -Xmx8G -Ddraios.agents.installParams.sslEnabled=false\" Deploy the configuration maps and secrets for all services by running the commands: For Sysdig Monitor: oc -n sysdigcloud apply -f sysdigcloud\/config.yaml (For Sysdig Secure only) Edit and apply secrets for Anchore and the scanning component: Edit the yaml files : scanning-secrets.yaml stringData:\n scanning.mysql.password: change_me anchore-secrets yaml stringData:\n anchore.admin.password: change_me\n anchore.db.password: change_me Then apply the files: oc -n sysdigcloud apply -f sysdigcloud\/scanning-secrets.yaml\noc -n sysdigcloud apply -f sysdigcloud\/anchore-secrets.yaml Edit the API DNS name in either api-ingress.yaml or api-ingress-with-secure.yaml (if using Secure). The files are located in sysdigcloud\/ spec:\n rules:\n - host: <API_DNS_NAME>\n...\n\n tls:\n - hosts:\n - <API_DNS_NAME>\n secretName: sysdigcloud-ssl-secret Edit the collector DNS name in the file openshift-collector-router.yaml . Use the collector DNS name you created in the Prerequisites. The file is located in sysdigcloud\/openshift\/ . spec:\n host: <COLLECTOR_DNS_NAME> Step 3 (Secure-Only): Edit mysql-deployment.yaml If using Sysdig Secure : Edit the MySQL deployment to uncomment the MYSQL_EXTRADB_* environment variables. This forces MySQL to create the necessary scanning database on startup. File location: datastores\/as_kubernetes_pods\/manifests\/mysql\/mysql-deployment.yaml - name: MYSQL_EXTRADB_SCANNING_DBNAME\n valueFrom:\n configMapKeyRef:\n name: sysdigcloud-config\n key: scanning.mysql.dbname\n - name: MYSQL_EXTRADB_SCANNING_USER\n valueFrom:\n configMapKeyRef:\n name: sysdigcloud-config\n key: scanning.mysql.user\n - name: MYSQL_EXTRADB_SCANNING_PASSWORD\n valueFrom:\n secretKeyRef:\n name: sysdigcloud-scanning\n key: scanning.mysql.password\n The scanning service will not start unless MySQL creates the scanning database. Step 4 Deploy Your Quay Pull Secret A specific Quay pull secret is sent via email with your license key. Edit the file sysdigcloud\/pull-secret.yaml and change the place holder <PULL_SECRET> with the provided pull secret. vi sysdigcloud\/pull-secret.yaml\n \n ---\n apiVersion: v1\n kind: Secret\n metadata:\n name: sysdigcloud-pull-secret\n data:\n .dockerconfigjson: <PULL_SECRET>\n type: kubernetes.io\/dockerconfigjson Deploy the pull secret object: oc -n sysdigcloud apply -f sysdigcloud\/pull-secret.yaml Step 5 Set Up SSL Connectivity to the Backend SSL-secured communication is used between user browsers and the Sysdig API server(s), and between the Sysdig agent and the collectors. To set this up, you must: Use an existing wildcard SSL certificate and key, or Use existing standard certs for API and collector, or Create self-signed certificates and keys for API and collector If you are not using wildcard SSL, you have to use two separate certificates, one for API URL and one for the collector. To disable SSL between agent and collector: To disable SSL between agent and collectors, you set a JVM option when configuring backend components . To create self-signed certs: Run these commands (edit to add your API_DNS_NAME and COLLECTOR_DNS_NAME ): openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3650 -nodes -x509 -subj \"\/C=US\/ST=CA\/L=SanFrancisco\/O=ICT\/CN=<API_DNS_NAME>\" -keyout server.key -out server.crt\nopenssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3650 -nodes -x509 -subj \"\/C=US\/ST=CA\/L=SanFrancisco\/O=ICT\/CN=<COLLECTOR_DNS_NAME>\" -keyout collector.key -out collector.crt To use an existing wildcard cert: Obtain the respective server.crt and server.key files. To create Kubernetes secrets for the certs: With Wildcard Uses the same certificate for both the API\/UI and the collector. Run these commands: oc -n sysdigcloud create secret tls sysdigcloud-ssl-secret --cert=server.crt --key=server.key\noc -n sysdigcloud create secret tls sysdigcloud-ssl-secret-collector --cert=server.crt --key=server.key Without Wildcard Uses two different certificates, one for the API\/UI, and one for the collector. Run these commands: oc -n sysdigcloud create secret tls sysdigcloud-ssl-secret --cert=server.crt --key=server.key\noc -n sysdigcloud create secret tls sysdigcloud-ssl-secret-collector --cert=collector.crt --key=collector.key Step 6 (Optional): Use CA Certs for External SSL Connections The Sysdig platform may sometimes open connections over SSL to certain external services, including: LDAP over SSL SAML over SSL OpenID Connect over SSL HTTPS Proxies If the signing authorities for the certificates presented by these services are not well-known to the Sysdig Platform (e.g., if you maintain your own Certificate Authority), they are not trusted by default. To allow the Sysdig platform to trust these certificates, use the command below to upload one or more PEM-format CA certificates. You must ensure you've uploaded all certificates in the CA approval chain to the root CA. oc -n sysdigcloud create secret generic sysdigcloud-java-certs --from-file=certs1.crt --from-file=certs2.crt Prerequisites Overview DNS Preparation Option 1: DNS without Wildcard Option 2: DNS with Wildcard SSL Certificate Preparation SSL with Wildcard SSL without Wildcard Prepare the Environment Step 1 Download and Unpack the Latest Release Step 2 Configure Backend Components Step 3 (Secure-Only): Edit mysql-deployment.yaml Step 4 Deploy Your Quay Pull Secret Step 5 Set Up SSL Connectivity to the Backend To disable SSL between agent and collector: To create self-signed certs: To use an existing wildcard cert: To create Kubernetes secrets for the certs: Step 6 (Optional): Use CA Certs for External SSL Connections " },

"body" : "Understand the Choice Points When planning an on-premises installation, the following choice points must be decided upon. Infrastructure Managers: To install Sysdig on-premises, administrators choose one of two infrastructure managers: Kubernetes (see Sysdig Install on Kubernetes 1.9+ ), or Replicated: an easy-to-use orchestrator that includes a GUI management tool. This guide describes how to install the Replicated client and use it to install and manage the Sysdig platform. Single-Host or Multi-Host Install: For test or proof-of-concept installations, a single-host install will include all components; for production, a distributed environment is needed. Airgapped or non-airgapped environment: If your environment is accessible to the Internet during the install process, then the installation options include both script-based or GUI-based. In airgapped environments (no Internet access), you must download components into your airgapped repository, and can only use the GUI-based installation. See Airgapped Installation . Where to put the Replicated Management Console: When installing on-premises using Replicated as the orchestrator, the following Replicated components will be installed on your system: Replicated UI (on a host you designate to host the Replicated Management Console) Replicated retraced containers that handle logging (on the Management Console host only) Replicated operator component (will go on all hosts) In a multi-host installation, one server will be the Replicated Management Console host. The system load for these components is minor. No matter which installation options you choose, you will use the Replicated GUI post-installation to: Start\/stop Sysdig components Upgrade Sysdig backend components Collect and view logs ( support bundles ). Understand the Installation Process Review and complete the Pre-Install requirements. If installing on multiple nodes, decide which node will host the Replicated Management Console. If using an airgapped environment, set up for an Airgapped Installation . Install the Replicated Client on a host. Log In to Replicated Management Console and set the Replicated Management Console Password. Configure Sysdig Admin Password and Basic Settings . Configure Sysdig Application Advanced Settings (if necessary). Complete Distributed Install Steps (if necessary). Restart the host(s).

Perform the following steps to download the required Sysdig installation files, the Replicated components, and the Sysdig license file, and save them to a repository on your airgapped server. Then perform the setup steps in the Replicated Management Console, as described below. Prerequisites Instructions Download Components to a Repository Install and Set Up Replicated Management Infrastructure Complete the Installation Steps Prerequisites A server instance with Docker version 1.7.1 or later installed is required prior to installation. The Replicated .airgap installation script does not install docker-engine . Sysdig recommends using the latest version of Docker available for the server operating system. For more information on installing Docker in an airgapped environment, refer to the Installing Docker in an Airgapped Environment documentation. Instructions Download Components to a Repository Download the latest Sysdig installation files using the links provided by the Sysdig Sales Engineer: The Sysdig platform application . airgap package The Sysdig application license file ( .rli ) (Optional) The Sysdig Agent Docker image Download the latest Replicated installation file from: https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/replicated-airgap-work\/replicated.tar.gz Copy all downloaded files to a designated location on your airgapped server. For example: \/var\/tmp\/sysdig (Note this path to be used when you complete the Install Using the Replicated GUI .) Open a command shell on the airgapped server and extract the replicated.tar.gz file: sudo tar xzvf replicated.tar.gz Install and Set Up Replicated Management Infrastructure Run the following command to install the Replicated infrastructure manager: sudo cat .\/install.sh | sudo bash -s airgap In a browser, navigate to the Replicated Management Console: https:\/\/server_address:8800 ( Replace server_address with the server name\/IP address.) Accept the default self-signed certificate, or provide a custom one, and click Continue . On the next screen, once the “preflight” checks have been resolved, select the Airgapped option, and click Continue . Upload the .rli license file. Provide a path to the Sysdig application .airgap file. Should you need to upgrade an airgapped license at a future time, see Upgrade an On-Premises License .

If multi-host, decide which machine will also run the Replicated Admin Console and begin there. If your environment is \"airgapped\" (no access to inbound or outbound internet traffic), there are some setup steps you must perform before doing the GUI-based Replicated installation. See Airgapped Installation for details. Install the Replicated Client Log in to the chosen machine with a shell and run a command to install the Replicated components. You can also install Docker if it's not already on the environment. Log into the designated server instance with SSH. Run the following commands: a. To install the Replicated Infrastructure and Docker: sudo curl -sSL https:\/\/install.sysdigcloud.com\/docker | sudo bash b. If Docker is already installed on the server instance, add -s --no-docker to the command: sudo curl -sSL https:\/\/install.sysdigcloud.com\/docker | sudo bash -s -- no-docker c. If installing the Replicated Infrastructure behind a proxy, modify the installation command as shown below: sudo curl -sSL -x http:\/\/<proxy>:<port> -o \/tmp\/sdc-onpremises-installer.sh https:\/\/install.sysdigcloud.com\/docker && bash \/tmp\/sdc-onpremises-installer.sh http-proxy=http:\/\/<proxy>:<port> Define Basic Settings & License Info Log In to Replicated Admin Console\/ \"admin console\" and Set SSL Certificate As prompted, open the Replicated Client at https:\/\/<yourserver>:8800. Supply the DNS hostname for the Replicated Admin Console. Accept the self-signed certificate, or upload a custom SSL certificate and private key. Note: If a self-signed certificate is uploaded, it must include the end user, all intermediate, and the root certificates, as the certificate will be used by the Sysdig platform, as well as for the Replicated Admin Console. To later replace a self-sign cert with a custom cert, see Replace a Self-Signed Cert . Click the Choose License button, and upload the Sysdig license file supplied from Sysdig Sales. Choose Online installation option if prompted. Set the Replicated Admin Console Password Once the Sysdig license validation is complete, secure the Replicated Admin Console using a local password, LDAP user account, or anonymous access (insecure). Sysdig recommends securing the console with either a local password or LDAP user account. Click Continue . Configure Sysdig Super Admin Password and Basic Settings After clicking Continue, the Settings page is displayed. Here you enter the configuration information that will be used by Replicated to orchestrate the Sysdig installation. Configure the Basic Settings for the Sysdig installation Hostname: The host name where the Replicated Admin Console is installed (re-enter). By default, the value is the admin server's public IP. If the Sysdig Monitor instance is installed behind a private network, firewall, or proxy, configure the hostname to the server's private address or routable DNS. Admin User\/Default User: The Sysdig administrator (super admin) Email and Password . Save this account information in a secure place.

JVM Entries (Required) Any JVM options to be passed to the application, such as memory constraint settings for the Java Virtual Machine components, proxy settings, etc. At a minimum, it is recommended to define the memory constraints, in the format: -Xms###g Xmx###g . Note that if multiple components are on a single machine, adjust the percentages as needed so JVMs all fit in a node. Cassandra JVM options : recommended to allocate 50% of the host's memory to this JVM (in a multi-node environment) Elasticsearch JVM options: recommended to allocate 50% of the host's memory to this JVM (in a multi-node environment) Sysdig Cloud application JVM options: recommended to allocate up to 80% of the host's memory to this JVM. This is also used to set proxy settings; see HTTP\/HTTPS and Proxy Support . It is also used to set an implicit key in AWS; see AWS: Integrate AWS Account and CloudWatch Metrics (Optional) . NOTE: If you do not want to use SSL between the agent and the collectors, you append the following settings to the Sysdig Cloud application JVM options entry: -Ddraios.agents.installParams.sslEnabled=false E.g. -Xms8G Xmx8G -Ddraios.agents.installParams.sslEnabled=false Ports and Security Sysdig UI port: default 80. Port used for the Sysdig Monitor\/ Sysdig Secure GUI. Sysdig UI secure port: default 433. SSL port used for Sysdig Monitor\/ Sysdig Secure GUI. Force HTTPS: This turns off the unsecured port (80) access. Forward Sysdig application logs to stdout : switches logging from the application log files to Linux standard output ( stdout) . Sysdig collector port: default 6443. Port used for agent metrics collection. See also Agent Installation . In earlier versions, the Sysdig Agent connected to port 6666. This behavior has been deprecated, as the Sysdig agent now connects to port 6443. Sysdig secure collector port: default 6443. Port used for agent metrics collection. See also Agent Installation . Exposed port for HTTP traffic inbound to Sysdig Platform backend container: 27878 – do not change without the recommendation of Sysdig Support.

After Saving, click Start Now to apply settings to the environment immediately. Click Cancel to apply settings at a later time. Single-Host Installation Wrap-Up After completing the Settings and restarting, no further installation steps are required for a single-host install. The dashboard will remain in Starting mode for approximately 4-5 minutes, depending on the internet connection bandwidth, while Sysdig application software is downloaded and installed. Once the installation is complete, the dashboard will move to Started mode. Click the Open link to navigate to the Sysdig Monitor login panel. Input the Super Admin user login credentials defined in the basic settings, above. Next Steps To start, stop, and update the application, or to retrieve support information, use the Replicated Admin Console: https:\/\/<yourserver>:8800 . To login as a user and see metrics for hosts with the Sysdig Agent installed, use the Sysdig Monitor Web Interface: https:\/\/<yourserver>:80 If you have not yet done so, install Sysdig Agents to monitor your environment. See Agent Installation for details. Multi-Host Installation Wrap-Up After configuring the settings and clicking Start Now , an error will indicate the need to assign and install the remaining components. You will need to define the hosts\/nodes to be used and will assign the Sysdig components to be installed on them. The steps below describe the actions on one host; they must be repeated on all applicable hosts and all the Sysdig components must be assigned. Choose the Cluster tab in the Replicated Admin Console. From here, you can tag components to be run on the local host, and\/or add new nodes. To add and configure new nodes: Click Add Node . The Add Node worksheet is displayed. Here you enter the IP address and then tag the Sysdig component(s) to be installed on that node. Replicated will compile either an installation script or a Docker run command out of your entries, which you will copy and use on the given node. On the Add Node worksheet page, do the following: Choose Installation script or Docker run command option. Enter private and\/or public IP address, depending on the type of access you want to permit. Select the Sysdig components to be installed by checking the appropriate \"Tags\" buttons. Descriptions in the table below: Name Tag Role Description api api Application Programming Interface server cassandradb cassandra Cassandra database server elasticsearch elasticsearch Elasticsearch server for events storage\/search collector collector Agent metrics collector lb_collector lb_collector Load balancer for collector service; handles connections from the agents lb_api lb_api Load balancer for API service; handles user connection requests to the Sysdig application. Use the address for this node as the DNS entry for the cluster. mysql, redis mysql & redis MySQL & Redis databases worker worker Metrics history processor emailrenderer emailrenderer Email renderer nginxfrontend nginxfrontend Frontend static server When setting up a DNS entry for the cluster, use the address for the ' lb_api' node. At the bottom of the page, a curl script or Docker run command is compiled for you. Copy the command and issue it on the targeted host. Repeat this procedure on all desired hosts. Restart the Sysdig application from the Replicated console. The dashboard will be in “Starting” mode for several minutes while software is downloaded and installed onto each server component (depending on your internet connection bandwidth). You should see green check marks for each host next to the Provisioned and Connected columns, as the software is installed and the node connects successfully to the Replicated Admin server. Once the installation is fully completed, the infrastructure admin dashboard will be in “Started” mode and will also show the “Open” link that will bring you to Sysdig Monitor web interface login screen. At the login screen, use the credentials configured earlier (Default User) to log in and start using the Sysdig application on-premises solution. To start, stop, and update the application or retrieve support information use the Replicated Admin dashboard: https:\/\/server_address:8800 To log in as a user and see metrics about hosts where Sysdig agents are installed, use the Sysdig Monitor UI: https:\/\/server_address:80 " },

"body" : "See also Get Help | Using Sysdig Support (On-Prem) Docker Connectivity Issues (IPv4\/IPv6) Some issues with IPv4 and IPv6 interconnectivity between on-premises containers and the outside world have been detected. IP packet forwarding is governed by the ip_forward system parameter. Packets can only pass between containers if this parameter is 1 . Usually, you will simply leave the Docker server at its default setting --ip-forward=true and Docker will go set ip_forward to 1 for you when the server starts up. If you set --ip-forward=false and your system’s kernel has it enabled, the --ip-forward=false option has no effect. To check the setting on your kernel use: sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding To turn it on use: sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1 Please see this article from docker for more details on Docker Connectivity. Proxy\/Firewall Issues Prior to installing ensure your proxy settings are valid for the session. You can use curl , lynx , or wget to test internet connectivity: export http_proxy=\"http:\/\/user:password@proxy_server:port\" \nexport https_proxy=\"https:\/\/user:password@proxy_server:port\"\necho $http_proxy You can then attempt a curl or docker hub call to ensure outside connectivity. Firewall Prior to installation, you may want to disable local firewall (iptables) to rule out local connectivity issues.

"body" : " A change was introduced in how events are indexed and stored in version 1149 of the Sysdig platform. Prior to this version, the three types of events were stored in three separate indexes, based on their different sources: Alert events : stored in MySQL ( alert_notifications table) Custom events (from both the infrastructure components and any custom event integrations): stored in ElasticSearch ( events_v1 index) Policy events (from Sysdig Secure): stored in ElasticSearch ( policy_event_v1 index) With version 1149 , they will be combined in one index. The Unified Events migration tool is delivered as a Docker container and is used to migrate events from multiple sources to a single source. When the migration and upgrade are complete, you manually terminate the migration tool. It is highly recommended to run the migration tool BEFORE launching the upgrade to version 1149. If you do not migrate before upgrading, you will lose visibility to old custom events in the Sysdig Monitor UI. Prerequisites You must be running Sysdig platform version 1091 . If your on-premises version is less than 1091, upgrade appropriately before running the migration tool. It is highly recommended to follow upgrade best practices: Keep upgrades current Upgrade progressively without skipping versions, and Test upgrades in a non-mission-critical or staging environment before rolling in to production. The migration tool container must have network visibility to the data sources used for re-indexing: MySQL and ElasticSearch. Launch migration before upgrading to version 1149. Where to Find the Tool The migration tool is provided as a containerized JavaApp on a public Quay repository. The Kubernetes and Replicated steps below give the precise location. Running the Migration Since events are constantly being generated, the migration tool executes the migration in batches. After each batch is indexed, the tool will try to fetch the next one, with a predefined cutoff. When the tool finishes indexing old events and has begun to wait for new ones, the Sysdig application upgrade can be launched. In the background, during the upgrade, the tool ensures that incoming events in old indexes are properly reindexed to the new unified table. The migration steps are: Run the container image. Monitor the logs to see when old events have finished migrating. Launch the upgrade. Terminate the migration tool manually. Depending on your environment, follow the: Kubernetes Steps Replicated Steps Kubernetes Steps 1. Run the Container Image (K8s) Run the following command: kubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f MIGRATION_TOOL_SPECS.yaml Where MIGRATION_TOOL_SPECS is defined as follows. (You can obtain the .yaml template from GitHub repository or copy\/paste it from this document. ) ---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n labels:\n app: sysdigcloud\n role: event-migration\n name: sysdig-event-migration\nspec:\n containers:\n - name: event-migration\n image: quay.io\/sysdig\/onprem_migration:combined-events_0.1.0_1091-1149\n env:\n - name: DB_ENDPOINT\n valueFrom:\n configMapKeyRef:\n name: sysdigcloud-config\n key: mysql.endpoint\n - name: DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT\n value: \"4000\" # Tweak parameter if necessary\n - name: DB_SOCKET_TIMEOUT\n value: \"14000\" # Tweak parameter if necessary\n - name: DB_USER\n valueFrom:\n configMapKeyRef:\n name: sysdigcloud-config\n key: mysql.user\n - name: DB_PASSWORD\n valueFrom:\n configMapKeyRef:\n name: sysdigcloud-config\n key: mysql.password\n - name: ES_ENDPOINT\n valueFrom:\n configMapKeyRef:\n name: sysdigcloud-config\n key: elasticsearch.url\n - name: ES_PORT\n value: \"9200\" # Change this param if different\n - name: BATCH_SIZE\n value: \"500\"\n - name: ALERT_EVENTS\n value: \"true\"\n - name: CUSTOM_EVENTS\n value: \"true\"\n - name: POLICY_EVENTS\n value: \"true\"\n - name: ONPREM\n value: \"true\"\n - name: REPAIR_MODE\n value: \"false\" Sample logger output: 2018-07-26 10:42:49.129 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : Started EventMigration in 21.956 seconds (JVM running for 23.097)\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.130 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : ====================== Onprem ======================\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.131 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * DB Settings\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.131 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Connection Endpoint: mysql-master.staging.sysdigcloud.com\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.131 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Connection Timeout: 4000\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.131 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Socket Timeout: 15000\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.132 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Username: admin\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.132 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Password: *********\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.132 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : *\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.134 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * ES Settings\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.134 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Endpoint Url: http:\/\/localhost\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.134 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Endpoint Port: 9200\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.139 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : *\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.139 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * Migration Settings\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.139 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Batch Size: 250\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.139 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : *\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.139 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * Active Migrations\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.140 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- custom-events\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.141 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- alert-events\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.141 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- policy-events\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.141 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : *\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.141 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * Migration is running in NORMAL mode\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.141 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : ==================================================\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.158 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.services.MigrationService : --- Executing alertEventMigration ---\n2018-07-26 10:42:51.499 INFO 8 --- [ main] c.s.m.events.AlertEventMigration : Starting from id 0\n2018-07-26 10:42:51.681 INFO 8 --- [ main] c.s.m.events.AlertEventMigration : Event count to be migrated: 8251 2.

Terminate the Migration Tool (K8s) When the Sysdig platform update is complete, leave the migration tool running for at least 3 minutes. To verify that the process is complete, check in the logs that custom events are no longer migrating. Sample output: 2018-07-25 10:00:49.484 INFO 7 --- [ main] com.sysdig.services.MigrationService : --- Executing customEventMigration ---\n2018-07-25 10:00:49.607 INFO 7 --- [ main] c.s.m.events.CustomEventMigration : Starting from id 0\n2018-07-25 10:00:49.882 INFO 7 --- [ main] c.s.m.events.CustomEventMigration : Event count to be migrated: 0\n2018-07-25 10:00:50.148 INFO 7 --- [ main] c.s.m.events.CustomEventMigration : No more custom_event to migrate... Then terminate the migration tool by running the following command: kubectl -n sysdigcloud delete -f {migration_tool_specs}.yaml Migration and upgrade are complete. If necessary, check the Troubleshooting tips. Replicated Steps If your environment is airgapped, you need to create an \"image\" of the migration tool that can be used on an airgapped install. Otherwise, proceed with 1. Run the Container Image . Prerequisite for Airgapped Environments Pull the image onto a host that has access to the Internet: docker pull quay.io\/sysdig\/onprem_migration:combined-events_0.1.0_1091-1149 Save the downloaded image to a TAR file: docker save -o migrate.tar quay.io\/sysdig\/onprem_migration Move the image TAR to the airgapped machine and deploy the image: docker load -i migrate.tar Continue with the Replicated steps, below. 1. Run the Container Image (Replicated) Ensure that the container has network visibility to the MySQL and ElasticSearch components. Run the migration tool container on a Coordinating Replicated Node, and run the container using the private addresses of data source endpoints. The data source endpoints can be found on the Replicated Dashboard, in Cluster settings. Other parameters, such as DB usernames, can be found in the Settings section of the Replicated Dashboard console. NOTE: The MySQL password was set when the Sysdig back end was installed using Replicated . The administrator needed to save and remember the DB passwords that were set, as they are not visible in the Replicated console. Execute the following Docker run command, providing the values described in the Appendix - Migration Tool Container Parameters . In Docker command format: docker run -d --name sysdig-event-migration -e DB_ENDPOINT=10.111.0.1 -e DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=4000 -e DB_SOCKET_TIMEOUT=12000 -e DB_USER=root -e DB_PASSWORD=<password> -e BATCH_SIZE=350 -e ES_ENDPOINT=http:\/\/10.111.0.1 -e ALERT_EVENTS=true -e CUSTOM_EVENTS=true -e POLICY_EVENTS=true -e REPAIR_MODE=false -e ONPREM=true quay.io\/sysdig\/onprem_migration:combined-events_0.1.0_1091-1149 With annotations for docker run -d --name sysdig-event-migration \\\n -e DB_ENDPOINT=<mysql_url> \\ # <mysql_url> should be address without protocol defined (e.g. without 'http:\/\/')\n -e DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=<connection_timeout> \\\n -e DB_SOCKET_TIMEOUT=<socket_timeout> \\\n -e DB_USER=<user_name> \\\n -e DB_PASSWORD=<password> \\\n -e BATCH_SIZE=<batch_size> \\\n -e ES_ENDPOINT=<elasticsearch_endpoint> \\ # <elasticsearch_endpoint> should be address with protocol defined (e.g.with 'http:\/\/')\n -e ES_PORT=<elasticsearch_port> \\ # Default port is 9200, needs to be changed in case of custom value\n -e ALERT_EVENTS=true \\\n -e CUSTOM_EVENTS=true \\\n -e POLICY_EVENTS=true \\\n -e REPAIR_MODE=false \\\n -e ONPREM=true \\\n quay.io\/sysdig\/onprem_migration:combined-events_0.1.0_1091-1149 Sample logger output: 2018-07-26 10:42:49.129 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : Started EventMigration in 21.956 seconds (JVM running for 23.097)\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.130 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : ====================== Onprem ======================\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.131 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * DB Settings\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.131 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Connection Endpoint: mysql-master.staging.sysdigcloud.com\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.131 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Connection Timeout: 4000\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.131 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Socket Timeout: 15000\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.132 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Username: admin\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.132 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Password: *********\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.132 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : *\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.134 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * ES Settings\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.134 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Endpoint Url: http:\/\/localhost\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.134 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Endpoint Port: 9200\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.139 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : *\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.139 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * Migration Settings\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.139 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- Batch Size: 250\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.139 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : *\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.139 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * Active Migrations\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.140 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- custom-events\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.141 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- alert-events\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.141 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * -- policy-events\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.141 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : *\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.141 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : * Migration is running in NORMAL mode\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.141 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.EventMigration : ==================================================\n2018-07-26 10:42:49.158 INFO 8 --- [ main] com.sysdig.services.MigrationService : --- Executing alertEventMigration ---\n2018-07-26 10:42:51.499 INFO 8 --- [ main] c.s.m.events.AlertEventMigration : Starting from id 0\n2018-07-26 10:42:51.681 INFO 8 --- [ main] c.s.m.events.AlertEventMigration : Event count to be migrated: 8251 2.

The migration tool continues to run. 3. Upgrade the Sysdig Platform (Replicated) Check the Release Notes . Follow the process to Upgrade Replicated Installations . During upgrade, the tool will check periodically for new events. In Replicated, the upgrade requires ElasticSearch and MySQL servers to be restarted, so you will experience connection loss during upgrade. The migration tool is designed to handle this gracefully, so connection loss WARN messages in logs are expected and not a problem with the migration.

Then terminate the migration tool, by running the following command: docker stop sysdig-event-migration\ndocker rm sysdig-event-migration Migration and upgrade are complete. If necessary, check the Troubleshooting tips. Troubleshooting In rare cases, migration errors can occur due to incorrect container configuration, network latency, or temporary cluster overload. Temporary connection-loss errors in Replicated are expected and are not migration errors, as described in Upgrade the Sysdig Platform (Replicated) Migration Startup Errors Startup errors are normally due to incorrect environment variable settings. Check URL endpoints, passed credentials, flags, etc. Migration Process Errors If you were able to run migration successfully, it functioned for a while, and then began to experience errors, this is most likely caused by network latency or cluster overload. In these cases, the migration tool will try to reduce the pressure on the cluster by reducing batch size exponentially, with a predefined backoff wait time. Ultimately, if events cannot be indexed, the migration tool will skip the issued batch and try to index the next batch. Information about the failed batch will be stored in the MySQL table utility_metadata . Temporary Errors If errors are only temporary, simply proceed with Running the Migration Steps . When migration is complete, run the migration container again with the -e REPAIR_MODE=true parameter. This will index all failed migrations stored in the MySQL table utility_metadata . Continuous Errors At this point, abort the migration attempt. Check the number of errors to decide how to proceed. To do so, check the MySQL table with: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM utility_metadata WHERE metadata_id LIKE 'failure-%'; LOW Error Count (0 - 1000) Try to identify why errors started (i.e. temporary cluster overload), resolve the problem and re-run the migration. When migration is complete, run the migration container again with the -e REPAIR_MODE=true parameter. This will index all failed migrations stored in the MySQL table utility_metadata. HIGH Error Count (10,000+) Try to identify why errors started (i.e. temporary cluster overload), resolve the problem, and RESET the migration progress completely by clearing all content from the MySQL table utility_metadata . (e.g. DELETE FROM utility_metadata; ) Repeat Running the Migration Steps . Appendix - Migration Tool Container Parameters All parameters are defined as environment variables.

"body" : "When upgrading to Sysdig platform version 1765 on Kubernetes, it is necessary first to apply a migration tool, due to a change which transitions from MySQL Connector to Maria DB Connector. The migration tool sets the MySQL server authentication plugin for Sysdig admin user to mysql_native_password. Run the tool even if you are unsure whether the authentication plugin setting requirement matches your environment. If the tool detects that your setting is already compatible with MariaDB Connector, no changes will be made. After running the migration script, you will be ready to upgrade. Run the Migration Prerequisite The migration tool script must be run on a computer with access to Sysdig Kubernetes namespace (default name \" sysdigcloud \") Steps Download the migration tool script from https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes\/master\/migrations\/mysql\/mysql8-mariadb-conj-auth-migration\/mysql8-mariadb-conj-auth-migration.sh , by running: curl -O https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes\/v1765\/migrations\/mysql\/mysql8-mariadb-conj-auth-migration\/mysql8-mariadb-conj-auth-migration.sh or wget https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes\/v1765\/migrations\/mysql\/mysql8-mariadb-conj-auth-migration\/mysql8-mariadb-conj-auth-migration.sh Add \"execute\" permission and run the script: chmod u+x mysql8-mariadb-conj-auth-migration.sh\n.\/mysql8-mariadb-conj-auth-migration.sh You will be prompted to enter values: Kubernetes context : By default, the script uses the current Kubernetes context for the migration. Enter a different context if required. Kubernetes namespace : By default, the script assumes the default name for Sysdig Kubernetes namespace \" sysdigcloud \". Enter a different namespace if required. (optional) MySQL port, root username, and root password : The script attempts to run the migration with the default values for MySQL port, root user, and root password. If custom values are required, the script will prompt you to enter them. Review the output. Note that the script cleans up after itself when the migration is complete.

"body" : "Sysdig platform on-premises releases are listed here . Each release has a version number and specific release notes. The v. 1765 release of Sysdig Platform includes a scanning feature in Sysdig Secure which requires some additional upgrade steps. If you are running only Sysdig Monitor, and do not want to use Sysdig Secure, you can perform a simpler upgrade. In this case, you would: Apply at minimum the mandatory releases, as listed here: On-Premises Upgrades . Run the Migration Tool . Run the basic Kubernetes Upgrade . If you are running Sysdig Secure on OpenShift, contact Sysdig Support for assistance upgrading to v. 1765. If you are running both Sysdig Monitor and Sysdig Secure (aka Sysdig Platform), use the instructions on this page. Overview The 1765 release of the Sysdig Platform supports the Sysdig Secure image scanning feature. Upgrading to this release requires adding components and changing existing components in your current Sysdig Platform implementation. These are the major changes: All ingress now uses an ingress controller. An additional database on the existing mysql deployment is required if you are using Sysdig Secure. There are additional Kubernetes services, deployments, and statefulsets. The “ sysdigcloud-config ” configmap has added many new key\/values. There are new Kubernetes secrets that are referenced by some components. Before You Upgrade Before upgrading to v. 1765, you must: Apply at minimum the mandatory releases, as listed here: On-Premises Upgrades . Run a Migration Tool . Complete all the installation steps on this page. It is highly recommended to follow upgrade best practices: Keep upgrades current Upgrade progressively without skipping versions, and Test upgrades in a non-mission-critical or staging environment before rolling into production. Steps Step 1 Download the sysdigcloud-kubernetes release Download the latest release of the sysdigcloud-kubernetes repo from https:\/\/github.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes\/releases\/latest Unpack the . tar file. Step 2 Update existing configmaps and add secrets Edit the sysdigcloud-config configmap and copy in the new Scanning and Anchore section from sysdigcloud\/config.yaml: kubectl -n sysdigcloud edit configmap sysdigcloud-config Create the scanning and anchore secrets: kubectl -n sysdigcloud apply -f .\/sysdigcloud\/scanning-secrets.yaml\nkubectl -n sysdigcloud apply -f .\/sysdigcloud\/anchore-secrets.yaml Step 3 Add a database to MySQL deployment You must manually create a new database on your existing MySQL endpoint and create a user and password for it. This database will be used by the scanning feature. Log in to your existing MySQL RDBMS and connect via the mysql cli program with the root user: kubectl -n sysdigcloud get pods\nkubectl -n sysdigcloud exec -it <any-mysql-pod> bash\nmysql --user=root --password=change_me\n CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `sysdig_scanning` ;\n CREATE USER 'scanninguser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'change_me' ;\n GRANT ALL ON `sysdig_scanning`.* TO 'scanninguser'@'%' ;\n FLUSH PRIVILEGES ;\n Step 4 Add Postgres statefulset and service Define the storage class that Postgres will use by editing the .\/datastores\/as_kubernetes_pods\/manifests\/postgres\/postgres-statefulset.yaml file, and changing the storageClassName ” setting to the desired storage class. Create the Postgres statefulset and service: kubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/datastores\/as_kubernetes_pods\/manifests\/postgres\/postgres-statefulset.yaml\nkubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/datastores\/as_kubernetes_pods\/manifests\/postgres\/postgres-service.yaml Wait for the Postgres statefulset to be running before proceeding. Step 5 Add anchore core and worker deployments and services Create the anchore configmaps: kubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/sysdigcloud\/anchore-core-config.yaml\nkubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/sysdigcloud\/anchore-worker-config.yaml Create the anchore core deployment: kubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/sysdigcloud\/anchore-core-deployment.yaml Wait for the anchore core pod to be running before proceeding. Create the remaining anchore kubernetes objects: kubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/sysdigcloud\/anchore-worker-deployment.yaml\nkubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/sysdigcloud\/anchore-service.yaml Step 6 Add the scanning deployments and service Create the scanning api deployment: kubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/sysdigcloud\/scanning-api-deployment.yaml Wait for the scanning-api pod to be running before proceeding. Create the remaining scanning kubernetes objects: kubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/sysdigcloud\/scanning-alertmgr-deployment.yaml\nkubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/sysdigcloud\/scanning-service.yaml Step 7 Add the ingress controller and redirect incoming API\/ UI traffic to it There will be a disruption in running agents during this upgrade while services are modified. Remove the following services: kubectl -n sysdigcloud delete service sysdigcloud-api\nkubectl -n sysdigcloud delete service sysdigcloud-collector Create the api-headless-service service: kubectl -n sysdigcloud create -f .\/sysdigcloud\/api-headless-service.yaml Create the ingress controller: Define <namespace> in ingress-clusterrolebinding.yaml .

However, if you have saved v1 dashboards and need to reapply them, follow these instructions: Migrate Saved Dashboards from V1 to V2 . Architecture Change in the Containers In previous releases, there was a single backend container which ran several processes. As of version 2304, the processes have been divided into unique containers, following container best practices. As a result, it is necessary to apply the entire configuration, not simply change the image version. Follow the instructions below. Review the Supported Migration Path and associated documents before you begin If you have licensed and will run only Sysdig Monitor, then you upgrade fewer components than if you also use Sysdig Secure, as described below. Download the New Version Use get to download the new version from Sysdig's GitHub and unzip it.

See https:\/\/sysdig.atlassian.net\/wiki\/spaces\/EN\/pages\/159875149\/Adding+a+Cassandra+Node+SAAS > This guide will explain how to expand the Cassandra cluster in a Sysdig Monitor multi-server, distributed on-premise installation. These steps were first tested with Sysdig Monitor on-premise release 439 and should work with all newer releases. H2: Expanding the Cluster Expanding the cluster is performed through the same management server interface that was used for the initial on-premise install procedure. Our example environment consists of 6 nodes (hosts\/VMs) as seen in the tab. The Tags reflect which component(s) are currently configured to run on each node. Assume we’ve provisioned an additional Linux host to be our new Cassandra node. Now click on the button. Insert the new host’s Private IP address, Public IP Address (if it has one), and check the box to add the Cassandra Tag. Then login to the new host and execute the provided curl command line. The additional node will now appear in the list. The new node is now initialized, but the Sysdig Monitor application must be restarted in order for Cassandra to begin running on it. To restart, click to the tab and click . Status messages will indicate services are stopping. Then click . As part of the restart, a new Cassandra container is started on the newly-added node and it will join the cluster. The joining operation can be monitored using the nodetool status command: H3: Status during joining (UJ) # docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> nodetool status draiosDatacenter: datacenter1 ======================= Status=Up\/Down |\/ State=Normal\/Leaving\/Joining\/Moving -- Address Load Tokens Owns Host ID Rack UN 10.10.0.117 41.8 MB 256 ? 3c495d49-f311-43f3-9fef-0055f5943f8a rack1 UJ 10.10.0.123 177.32 KB 256 ? 8199bfb4-92b3-4b74-a1ce-90310769d8b8 rack1 H3: Status when joined (UN) # docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> nodetool status draios Datacenter: datacenter1 ======================= Status=Up\/Down |\/ State=Normal\/Leaving\/Joining\/Moving -- Address Load Tokens Owns (effective) Host ID Rack UN 10.10.0.117 40.39 MB 256 51.2% 3c495d49-f311-43f3-9fef-0055f5943f8a rack1 UN 10.10.0.123 20.12 MB 256 48.8% 8199bfb4-92b3-4b74-a1ce-90310769d8b8 rack1 Adding a new node to a Cassandra cluster can take a long time depending on how much data is currently stored in the cluster. Do not stop the application until the new node has finished joining the cluster. H3: Cleanup Once the joining operation is finished, it is mandatory to perform a cleanup operation on all the old nodes of the cluster. This is performed using nodetool cleanup : # docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> bash root@<>:\/# nohup nodetool cleanup draios & [1] 470 root@<>:\/# nohup: ignoring input and appending output to 'nohup.out' root@<>:\/# exit H2: Data Replication Factor <Is this required or optional? When\/why do you do it?> The default Cassandra replication factor used by Sysdig Monitor is 1. This was first set under Advanced Settings within the tab of the management server interface. It should be noted that changing the replication factor on a running cluster is a rather costly procedure and therefore should be carefully planned. These steps should only be executed by those who understand the underlying Cassandra operations and are comfortable with executing them on your data within appropriately-sized change windows. Always first backup your data by copying the entire contents of the Cassandra data folder \/opt\/cassandra-data-volume. If you want to increase the replication factor, you need to manually modify the replication factor setting of the draios Keyspace in the Cassandra cluster. To do so, pick any node in the Cassandra cluster and execute the following commands to review and then change the replication factor setting (from 1 to 2 in this example): # docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> bash root@<>:\/# cqlsh cqlsh> DESCRIBE KEYSPACE draios ; CREATE KEYSPACE draios WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'} AND durable_writes = true; …. cqlsh> ALTER KEYSPACE draios WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 2 }; cqlsh> quit Modify the Cassandra replication factor in the Advanced Settings of the Sysdig Monitor management server interface to match this new setting (2 in this case). Saving the new setting will trigger a restart of the application. Once restart has completed, perform the Cassandra repair operation on the cluster, one node at a time: root@<>:\/# nodetool repair [2017-01-05 14:55:03,614] Starting repair command #1, repairing 512 ranges for keyspace draios (parallelism=SEQUENTIAL, full=true) Perform the repair operation on all the nodes of the cluster. Wait until repair completes on a node, then move on to the next one. Note the change in the Owns column for the nodetool status output. In our example with two nodes and replication factor of 2, the 100% values are expected. # docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> nodetool status draios Datacenter: datacenter1 ======================= Status=Up\/Down |\/ State=Normal\/Leaving\/Joining\/Moving -- Address Load Tokens Owns (effective) Host ID Rack UN 192.168.15.5 12.92 MB 256 100.0% dca3e7f8-fa0b-4de1-8562-c4150121f8c7 rack1 UN 192.168.15.6 12.92 MB 256 100.0% d8ea6d81-c7aa-4d49-8ea0-1fac2e136a5c rack1 " },

"body" : "These instructions are specific to On-Premises Deployments of the Sysdig platform. If you are using the cloud-based (SaaS) Sysdig platform, refer to Google OAuth (SaaS) instead. Google supports OAuth 2.0, which allows users to log in to third-party applications such as Sysdig using Google credentials. By default, the created user will not have Admin rights within the Sysdig application, though these rights can be subsequently assigned. Prerequisites The Sysdig platform on-premises installation must have a DNS name associated with it. Google does not support applications that do not have an associated DNS name. DNS Name Replicated For Replicated-based installations , enter your Hostname in the Settings tab. Kubernetes For Kubernetes-based installations , ensure the api.url ConfigMap element contains your hostname. For the examples that follow, DNS_NAME refers to this hostname you configured in your platform settings. In Google Console: Obtain OAuth Client Credentials Log in to the Google API Console . Select Credentials from the left-hand navigation, and choose the OAuth consent screen tab. Enter the required Email address and Product name , as well as other additional optional information, then click Save . From the Credentials tab, click the Create Credentials drop-down and select OAuth client ID . When prompted for Application type , select Web application , then enter the following parameters: Name: Use a meaningful name, such as \"Sysdig\". Authorized Javascript Origins: Enter https:\/\/DNS_NAME:API_PORT Authorized Redirect URLs: Enter one or more of the following values: If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter: https:\/\/DNS_NAME:API_PORT\/api\/oauth\/google\/auth If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter: https:\/\/DNS_NAME:API_PORT\/api\/oauth\/google\/secureAuth Click Create . A success message with client ID and client secret will be displayed. Copy these to a safe place, as you will need them in the next step. Configure Settings in Sysdig There are three options for configuring OAuth settings on the Sysdig side: a UI page (for Monitor only), scripts (both products), or entries in your Replicated or Kubernetes orchestrator (both products). Option 1 UI-Based: Configure Google OAuth in Settings (Monitor Only) At this time, the Authorization UI is available only for Sysdig Monitor. To enable baseline Google Oauth functionality: Enter Google OAuth Basic Settings Log in to Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure as \"super\" Admin and select Settings. Select Authentication . Select the Google OAuth tab. Enter the relevant parameters and click Save . Application ID: the Client ID you were sent. Application Secret: the Client Secret you were sent URL Redirect: If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter: https:\/\/DNS_NAME:API_PORT\/api\/oauth\/google\/auth If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter: https:\/\/DNS_NAME:API_PORT\/api\/oauth\/google\/secureAuth Allowed Domains: Comma-separated list of domains permitted to log in. For example, mycompany.com , myxompanyalias.com . Select Google OAuth for SSO Select Google Oauth from the Enabled Single Sign-On dropdown Click Save Authentication . Repeat for Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure, if you want to enable on both applications. Option 2 Script-Based: Configure OAuth Using Scripts (Monitor or Secure) The configuration of the Google OAuth feature can be viewed, updated, and deleted by the \"super\" Admin . A google_oauth_config.sh helper script is available in the SSO folder at sysdig-cloud-scripts repository to assist in completing this configuration. Invoking the script with no options will display help text. # .\/google_oauth_config.sh -h\nUsage: .\/google_oauth_config.sh [OPTIONS]\n\nAffect Google Oauth login settings for your Sysdig software platform installation\n To use the helper script, modify env.sh to set the required values for API_TOKEN of the \"super\" Admin user and the URL for accessing the Sysdig platform API (which will be the same URL that your users access for the Sysdig Monitor application). Depending if the API_TOKEN has been obtained from the Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure application UI, the settings will be applied to the consequent product. Initially no Google Oauth settings are set. A initial run of the script would confirm that: # .\/google_oauth_config.sh\nNo google-oauth settings are set\nRun for further info: .\/google_oauth_config.sh -h Add the -s option to set the Google Oauth configuration for a particular Sysdig application. When setting the config, you'll use additional options to provide the config details you saved in the earlier Google Oauth step. Config Detail Option Client ID -i Client Secret -e Allowed Domains -a Redirect URL -r If the configuration is successfully posted to the Sysdig platform, the new configuration will be echoed back. Depending if the API_TOKEN has been obtained from the Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure application UI, the settings will be applied to the relevant product. # .\/google_oauth_config.sh -s -i \"t2em0alq7l13n1hevua48ehieenkb06q.apps.googleusercontent.com\" -e \"ucP_WY908-k\" -r \"https:\/\/sysdigtest.com:443\/api\/oauth\/google\/auth\" -a \"[\\\"sysdig.com\\\"]\"\n{\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"id\": 1,\n \"version\": 1,\n \"createdOn\": 1547709552000,\n \"type\": \"google-oauth\",\n \"scope\": \"SYSTEM\",\n \"settings\": {\n \"clientId\": \"t2em0alq7l13n1hevua48ehieenkb06q.apps.googleusercontent.com\",\n \"clientSecret\": \"ucP_WY908-k\",\n \"redirectUrl\": \"https:\/\/sysdigtest.com:443\/api\/oauth\/google\/auth\",\n \"allowedDomains\": [\n \"sysdig.com\"\n ]\n }\n }\n} Once you've completed this configuration, clicking the Google Login button at the login screen of the appropriate Sysdig application(s) should redirect to Google Oauth login page. If you wish to delete your Google Oauth configuration, invoke the -d option. If successful, the disabled configuration will be printed. # .\/google_oauth_config.sh -d\n{\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"id\": 1,\n \"version\": 1,\n \"createdOn\": 1547709552000,\n \"type\": \"google-oauth\",\n \"scope\": \"SYSTEM\",\n \"settings\": {\n \"clientId\": \"t2em0alq7l13n1hevua48ehieenkb06q.apps.googleusercontent.com\",\n \"clientSecret\": \"ucP_WY908-k\",\n \"redirectUrl\": \"https:\/\/sysdigtest.com:443\/api\/oauth\/google\/auth\",\n \"allowedDomains\": [\n \"sysdig.com\"\n ]\n }\n }\n} Option 3 Orchestrator-Based: Enter Settings Using Orchestrator (Monitor or Secure) Replicated If you used the Replicated infrastructure manager to install the Sysdig platform: Log in to the Replicated Management Console, click to the Settings tab, then check the box to expand the Advanced Settings . Enter the Google OAuth client ID and Google OAuth client Secret in the appropriate fields. (Optional) In a comma-separated list, enter the OAuth-allowed email domains that should be permitted to authenticate. If set, only Google users whose email addresses are in these domains will be able to login to your Sysdig installation. If this setting is left blank, any user that successfully authenticates via Google will be permitted to login to your Sysdig installation. Click Save .The Sysdig platform will then restart to enable the settings. Kubernetes Enter the OAuth allowed domains, Client ID , and Client Secret into the appropriate elements of the Kubernetes ConfigMap . Use appropriate Kubernetes methods to push the updated settings and restart the backend containers to make the changes take effect. # Optional: OAuth allowed domains (comma separated list of domains) sysdigcloud.oauth.allowed.domains.list: \"\" # Optional: Sysdig Cloud Google OAuth Client ID sysdigcloud.google.oauth.client.id : \"\" # Optional: Sysdig Cloud Google OAuth Client Secret sysdigcloud.google.oauth.client.secret: \"\" User Experience Note the following requirements for successful Google OAuth login: The user must have already logged in successfully at least once to your environment (such as via email-based Invitation and having set an initial password) The user's login username in the Sysdig platform must precisely match the user's Google email address (that is, it cannot be a shortened\/altered Google email alias) For such a user to log in via Google OAuth, click the Log in with Google button. If the user's browser has not already successfully authenticated via Google and\/or has multiple Google profiles known by their browser, they will be presented a Google page to select a profile and enter a password (if necessary) before being redirected back to your Sysdig environment.

"body" : "This guide is specific to cloud-based (SaaS) Sysdig environments. If you are configuring an On-Premises Sysdig environment, refer to SAML (On-Prem) instead. SAML support in the Sysdig platform allows authentication via your choice of Identity Provider (IdP) . The Sysdig platform ordinarily maintains its own user database to hold a username and password hash. SAML instead allows for redirection to your organization's IdP to validate username\/password and other policies necessary to grant access to Sysdig application(s). Upon successful authentication via SAML, a corresponding user record in the Sysdig platform’s user database is automatically created, though the password that was sent to the IdP is never seen nor stored by the Sysdig platform. This section describes how to integrate and enable SAML with both Sysdig Monitor and Sysdig Secure. For specific IdP integration information, refer to: Okta (SAML On-Prem) OneLogin (SAML On-Prem) See also Caveats . Basic Enablement Workflow Step Options Notes 1. Know which IdP your company uses and will be configuring. Okta (SAML On-Prem) OneLogin (SAML On-Prem) These are the IdPs for which Sysdig has performed detailed interoperability testing and confirmed how to integrate using their standard docs. If your IDP is not listed, it may still work with the Sysdig platform. Contact Sysdig Support for help. 2. Decide the login flow you want users to experience (choose from three options): Click SAML button From https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/ or https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/secure Type\/bookmark a URL in browser Monitor: https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/api\/saml Secure: https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/api\/saml?product=SDS Log in from an IdP interface The individual IdP integration pages describe how to add Sysdig to the IdP interface. You will need your Sysdig customer number on hand. Normally 1 for on-premises. 3. Perform the configuration steps in your IdP interface and collect the resulting config attributes. Okta (SAML On-Prem) OneLogin (SAML On-Prem) Collect metadata URL (or XML) and test it. If you intend to configure IDP-initiated login flow, have your Sysdig customer number on hand. It will be referenced in later configuration steps as CUSTOMER_ID_NUMBER . Normally 1. 4 a. Log in to Sysdig Monitor (as \"super\" admin) and enter the necessary configuration information in the UI. Enable SAML as your SSO. 4b. Log in to Sysdig Secure (as \"super\" admin) and enter configuration information using scripts. 4a. Sysdig Monitor only 4b. Sysdig Monitor (optional) or Sysdig Secure Administrator Steps Configure IdP Select the appropriate IdP from the list below, and follow the instructions: Okta (SAML On-Prem) OneLogin (SAML On-Prem) UI-Based: Configure SAML in Settings (Monitor Only) At this time, the Authorization UI is available only for Sysdig Monitor. To enable baseline SAML functionality: Enter SAML Connection Settings Log in to Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure as administrator and select Settings. Select Authentication . Select the SAML tab. Enter the relevant parameters (see table below) and click Save . Connection Setting Options Description Sample Entry Metadata URL The URL provided at the end of the IdP configuration steps. XML An option that can be used for an IdP that doesn't support extracting metadata XML via URL. Signed Assertion off\/on Should Sysdig check for assertions signed in responses (to assist in validating correct IdP). ON Email Parameter email Name of parameter in the SAML response for user email ID. Sysdig uses this to extract the user's email from the response. email Validate Signature off\/on Sysdig backend should verify that the response is signed. ON Verify Destination off\/on Flag to control whether Sysdig should check the \"destination\" field in the SAMLResponse. Recommend ON, as a security measure. May be OFF in special cases, such as a proxy in front of the Sysdig back end. ON Select SAML for SSO Select SAML from the Enabled Single Sign-On dropdown Click Save Authentication . Repeat entire enablement process for Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure, if you want to enable on both applications. Script-Based: Configure SAML Using Scripts (Monitor or Secure) The configuration of the SAML feature can be viewed, updated, and deleted by the \"super\" Admin . A saml_config.sh helper script is available in the SSO folder at sysdig-cloud-scripts repository to assist in completing this configuration. Invoking the script with no options will display help text. # .\/saml_config.sh\nMust specify the Sysdig App whose SAML configuration will be viewed\/set\n\nUsage: .\/saml_config.sh [OPTIONS]\n\nAffect SAML login settings for your Sysdig software platform installation\n\nIf no OPTIONS are specified, only the help output is displayed. To use the helper script, modify env.sh to set the required values for API_TOKEN of the \"super\" Admin user and the URL for accessing the Sysdig platform API (which will be the same URL that your users access for the Sysdig Monitor application). Depending if the API_TOKEN has been obtained from the Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure application UI, the settings will be applied to the relevant product. Initially no SAML settings are set. A initial run of the script would confirm that: # .\/saml_config.sh\nNo saml settings are set\nRun for further info: .\/saml_config.sh -h\n Add the -s option to set the SAML configuration for a particular Sysdig application. When setting the config, you'll also include the metadata URL you saved in the earlier IDP configuration step ( -m option) and specify the name of a supported IDP configuration ( -i option), which will tailor other details of your SAML configuration to the specifics of that IDP. If the configuration is successfully posted to the Sysdig platform, the new configuration will be echoed back. An example of creating the two separate SAML configurations for both Monitor and Secure, each using Okta IDP settings: # .\/saml_config.sh -s -m 'https:\/\/dev-824158.oktapreview.com\/app\/exkfpgqiskSoGZrjE0h7\/sso\/saml\/metadata' -i okta\n{\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"id\": 1,\n \"version\": 1,\n \"createdOn\": 1547539750000,\n \"type\": \"saml\",\n \"scope\": \"SYSTEM\",\n \"settings\": {\n \"metadataUrl\": \"https:\/\/dev-824158.oktapreview.com\/app\/exkfpgqiskSoGZrjE0h7\/sso\/saml\/metadata\",\n \"metadata\": null,\n \"validateSignature\": true,\n \"emailParameter\": \"email\",\n \"signedAssertion\": true,\n \"verifyDestination\": true,\n \"createUserOnLogin\": true\n }\n }\n} If you are using an IDP other than those available with the -i option, contact Sysdig Support for assistance with determining the correct settings. Once you've completed this configuration, clicking the SAML button at the login screen of the appropriate Sysdig application(s) should redirect to your IDP for authentication. If you wish to delete your SAML configuration, invoke the -d option. If successful, the disabled configuration will be printed. # .\/saml_config.sh -a monitor -d\n{\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"id\": 1,\n \"version\": 1,\n \"createdOn\": 1547539750000,\n \"type\": \"saml\",\n \"scope\": \"SYSTEM\",\n \"settings\": {\n \"metadataUrl\": \"https:\/\/dev-824158.oktapreview.com\/app\/exkfpgqiskSoGZrjE0h7\/sso\/saml\/metadata\",\n \"metadata\": null,\n \"validateSignature\": true,\n \"emailParameter\": \"email\",\n \"signedAssertion\": true,\n \"verifyDestination\": true,\n \"createUserOnLogin\": true\n }\n }\n} Optional: Auto-creation of user records When a user successfully authenticates via SAML, if a user record does not yet exist in the Sysdig platform database for their email address, one will be created at that time (default behavior). Some environments may not like this approach and may instead only want to permit logins for users whose records already exist (such as may have been already created via email invite or creation via the API ). To disable the auto-creation of user records after SAML authentication, add the -n option to your command line when applying your settings. This will set createUserOnLogin to false . # .\/saml_config.sh -s -n -m 'https:\/\/dev-824158.oktapreview.com\/app\/exkfpgqiskSoGZrjE0h7\/sso\/saml\/metadata' -i okta\n{\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"id\": 2,\n \"version\": 1,\n \"createdOn\": 1547539856000,\n \"type\": \"saml\",\n \"scope\": \"SYSTEM\",\n \"settings\": {\n \"metadataUrl\": \"https:\/\/dev-824158.oktapreview.com\/app\/exkfpgqiskSoGZrjE0h7\/sso\/saml\/metadata\",\n \"metadata\": null,\n \"validateSignature\": true,\n \"emailParameter\": \"email\",\n \"signedAssertion\": true,\n \"verifyDestination\": true,\n \"createUserOnLogin\": false\n }\n }\n} User Experience As noted in the SAML (On-Prem)#Basic Enablement Workflow above, you can offer users three ways to log in with a SAML configuration: They can begin at the Sysdig SaaS URL and click the SAML button. Monitor: https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/ or Secure: https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/secure . They will be prompted to enter a Company Name, so the Sysdig platform can redirect the browser to your IdP for authentication. You can provide an alternative URL to avoid the user having to enter a company name, in the format: Sysdig Monitor: https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/api\/saml Sysdig Secure: https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/api\/saml?product=SDS You can configure an IdP-initiated login flow when configuring your IdP. The users then select the Sysdig application from your IDP's app directory and do not browse directly to a Sysdig application URL at all. Users that complete their first successful SAML login to Sysdig Secure may receive the error message \"User doesn't have permission to login in Sysdig Secure\". This is because only members of the Secure Operations team are permitted access to Sysdig Secure, and newly-created logins are not in this team by default. Such a user should contact an Administrator for the Sysdig environment to be added to the Secure Operations team. Environments that wish to have all users access Secure by default could use this example script to frequently \"sync\" the team memberships. See also User and Team Administration for information on creating users. Caveats SAML Assertion Encryption\/Decryption is not currently supported. SAML Single Logout is not supported. Therefore, users should take care to log out directly from Sysdig application(s).

"body" : "These instructions are specific to On-Premises Deployments of the Sysdig platform. If you are using the cloud-based (SaaS) Sysdig platform, refer to OpenID Connect (SaaS) instead. OpenID support in the Sysdig platform allows authentication via your choice of Identity Provider (IdP) . This section describes how to integrate and enable OpenID Connect with both Sysdig Monitor and Sysdig Secure. Overview Summary of OpenID Functionality in Sysdig The Sysdig platform ordinarily maintains its own user database to hold a username and password hash. OpenID instead allows for redirection to your organization's IdP to validate username\/password and other policies necessary to grant access to Sysdig application(s). Upon successful authentication via OpenID, a corresponding user record in the Sysdig platform’s user database is automatically created, though the password that was sent to the IdP is never seen nor stored by the Sysdig platform. Basic Enablement Workflow Step Options Notes 1. Know which IdP your company uses and will be configuring. Okta (OpenID On-Prem) OneLogin (OpenID On-Prem) Keycloak (OpenID On-Prem) These are the OpenID Providers for which Sysdig has performed detailed interoperability testing and confirmed how to integrate using their standard docs. If your OpenID Provider is not listed (including ones that do not support OpenID Connect Discovery ), it may still work with the Sysdig platform. Contact Sysdig Support for help. 2. Decide the login flow you want users to experience: 3 options Click OpenID button From https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/ or https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/secure Type\/bookmark a URL in browser Monitor: https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/api\/oauth\/openid Secure: https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/api\/oauth\/openid ?product=SDS Log in from an IdP interface The individual IdP integration pages describe how to add Sysdig to the IdP interface. You will need your Sysdig customer number on hand. 3. Perform the configuration steps in your IdP interface and collect the resulting config attributes. Okta (OpenID On-Prem) OneLogin (OpenID On-Prem) Keycloak (OpenID On-Prem) Collect metadata URL (or XML) and test it. If you intend to configure IDP-initiated login flow, Find Your Customer Number and have it on hand. It will be referenced in later configuration steps as CUSTOMER_ID_NUMBER . 4a. Log in to Sysdig Monitor Settings (as super admin) and enter the necessary configuration information in the UI. Save and Enable OpenID as your SSO. 4b. Configure settings for Sysdig Secure using scripts. 4a. Sysdig Monitor only 4b. Sysdig Monitor (optional) or Sysdig Secure Administrator Steps Configure IdP Select the appropriate IdP link below, and follow the instructions: Okta (OpenID On-Prem) OneLogin (OpenID On-Prem) Keycloak (OpenID On-Prem) UI-Based: Configure OpenID in Settings (Monitor Only) At this time, the Authorization UI is available only for Sysdig Monitor. To enable baseline OpenID functionality: Enter OpenID Basic Connection Settings Log in to Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure as administrator and select Settings. Select Authentication . Select the OpenID tab. Enter the relevant parameters (see table below) and click Save . Connection Setting Description Client ID ID provided by your IdP Client Secret Secret provided by your IdP Issuer URL URL provided by your IdP. Example: https:\/\/YOUR-ONELOGIN-DOMAIN.onelogin.com\/oidc Okta, OneLogin, and Keycloak support metadata auto-discovery, so these settings should be sufficient for those IdPs. Enter OpenID Additional Settings (if needed) In some cases, an OpenID IdP may not support metadata auto-discovery, and additional configuration settings must be entered manually. In this case: On the OpenID tab, toggle the Metadata Discovery button to OFF to display additional entries on the page. Enter the relevant parameters derived from your IdP (see table below) and click Save . Connection Setting Description Base Issuer Required. Often the same Issuer URL , but can be different for providers that have a separate general domain and user-specific domain (for example, general domain: https:\/\/openid-connect.onelogin.com\/oidc , user-specific domain: https:\/\/sysdig-phil-dev.onelogin.com\/oidc )f Authorization Endpoint Required. Authorization request endpoint Token Endpoint Required. Token exchange endpoint JSON Web Key Set Endpoint Required. Endpoint that contains key credentials for token signature verification Token Auth Method Authentication method. Supported values: client_secret_basic , client_secret_post . (case insensitive) Select OpenID for SSO Select OpenID from the Enabled Single Sign-On dropdown. Click Save Authentication . Script-Based: Configure OpenID Using Scripts (Monitor or Secure) The configuration of the OpenID Connect feature can be viewed, updated, and deleted by the \"super\" Admin . An oidc_config.sh helper script is available in the SSO folder at sysdig-cloud-scripts repository to assist in completing this configuration. Invoking the script with no options will display help text. # .\/oidc_config.sh\nMust specify the Sysdig App whose OpenID Connect configuration will be viewed\/set\n\nUsage: .\/oidc_config.sh [OPTIONS]\n\nAffect OpenID Connect login settings for your Sysdig software platform installation\n To use the helper script, modify env.sh to set the required values for API_TOKEN of the \"super\" Admin user and the URL for accessing the Sysdig platform API (which will be the same URL that your users access for the Sysdig Monitor application). Depending if the API_TOKEN has been obtained from the Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure application UI, the settings will be applied to the consequent product. Initially no OpenID settings are set. A initial run of the script would confirm that: # .\/oidc_config.sh\nNo openid settings are set\nRun for further info: .\/oidc_config.sh -h\n\n Add the -s option to set the OpenID Connect configuration for a particular Sysdig application. When setting the config, you'll use additional options to provide the config details you saved in the earlier OpenID Provider configuration step. Config Detail Option Issuer URL -u Client ID -i Client Secret -e If the configuration is successfully posted to the Sysdig platform, the new configuration will be echoed back. An example of creating the two separate OpenID Connect configurations for both Monitor and Secure, each using Okta as an OpenID Provider: # .\/oidc_config.sh -s -u https:\/\/dev-824158.oktapreview.com -i 0oafpykpv7JMS4gMe0h7 -e ZctTGJMNJmuseEJHJGhvnb0pniZvz9Gf6RStxhHn\n{\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"id\": 1,\n \"version\": 1,\n \"createdOn\": 1547541009000,\n \"type\": \"openid\",\n \"scope\": \"SYSTEM\",\n \"settings\": {\n \"issuer\": \"https:\/\/dev-824158.oktapreview.com\",\n \"clientId\": \"0oafpykpv7JMS4gMe0h7\",\n \"clientSecret\": \"ZctTGJMNJmuseEJHJGhvnb0pniZvz9Gf6RStxhHn\",\n \"metadataDiscovery\": true\n }\n }\n} Once you've completed this configuration, clicking the OpenID button at the login screen of the appropriate Sysdig application(s) should redirect to your OpenID Provider for authentication. If you wish to delete your OpenID Connect configuration, invoke the -d option. If successful, the disabled configuration will be printed. .\/oidc_config.sh -d\n{\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"id\": 1,\n \"version\": 1,\n \"createdOn\": 1547541009000,\n \"type\": \"openid\",\n \"scope\": \"SYSTEM\",\n \"settings\": {\n \"issuer\": \"https:\/\/dev-824158.oktapreview.com\",\n \"clientId\": \"0oafpykpv7JMS4gMe0h7\",\n \"clientSecret\": \"ZctTGJMNJmuseEJHJGhvnb0pniZvz9Gf6RStxhHn\",\n \"metadataDiscovery\": true\n }\n }\n} User Experience As noted in the OpenID Connect (On-Prem)#Basic Enablement Workflow above, you can offer users three ways to log in with a OpenID configuration: They can begin at the Sysdig SaaS URL and click the OpenID button.

"body" : "Introduction The LDAP Authentication Configuration (for Platform v. 963 - 1091) article describes LDAP functionality that's specific to the Sysdig software platform. However, the platform ultimately leverages common libraries that adhere to standards, such as in RFC2254 search filters. Therefore, many tips and best practices you can find online will apply to effective use of the LDAP features of the Sysdig platform. While it would not be feasible to capture all such available knowledge in one place, in this article we present pointers to some general LDAP tips you may find most useful. If you find additional LDAP techniques that have proven particularly useful in your Sysdig environment, we'd appreciate if you could share them with Sysdig Support so we can add them to this article. Testing Configurations With ldapsearch Small typos in fields such as search filters can cause failures that are difficult to debug. You may want to perfect your more complex configurations before applying them via the helper scripts. This will help \"divide & conquer\" as to whether an issue is generic to LDAP syntax and\/or the directory vs. a possible bug in the Sysdig platform. If you have an Ubuntu Linux host at your disposal that can access your directory server via LDAP, install the ldap-utils package: # sudo apt install ldap-utils If accessing LDAP over SSL\/TLS, edit the file \/etc\/ldap\/ldap.conf and add the following line: TLS_REQCERT allow Then copy the CA certificate (the same one that was uploaded in the Settings of the Replicated console) to a location on the host, such as \/tmp\/cert.pem . Now you can run arbitrary queries via generic LDAP and study their success or failure. For instance, the following command-line uses some of the settings from LDAP Authentication Configuration (for Platform v. 963 - 1091) examples: # LDAPTLS_CACERT=\/tmp\/cert.pem ldapsearch -H ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:636 -M -b \"DC=example,DC=local\" -D \"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\" -w \"myMgrPassword\" \"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName=jdoe))\"\n\n...\n# John Doe, Users, example.local\ndn: CN=John Doe,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local\n... Excluding Classes of Users (e.g. Disabled Accounts) Per this post , Active Directory admins may leverage certain queries to easily exclude certain classes of users from being able to authenticate to the Sysdig platform. For example, the following will filter out users whose accounts have been disabled in Active Directory. (!(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)) This can be combined with other config via AND logic, such as by extending one of our searchFilter examples: \"searchFilter\": \"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0})(!(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)))\" Introduction Testing Configurations With ldapsearch Excluding Classes of Users (e.g. Disabled Accounts) " },

LDAP support in the Sysdig software platform is used to allow user authentication using credentials in an enterprise's own directory server. This document describes how to configure base LDAP settings, as well as the LDAP Authentication Configuration (for Platform v.1586)#limitations of the LDAP support. Overview Functionality The Sysdig platform ordinarily maintains its own user database to hold a username and password hash, as well as settings for Admin privileges, Sysdig team membership, and a user’s configured dashboards and alerts. Sysdig's LDAP authentication feature provides a means to allow the Sysdig platform to query your separate directory server to validate username\/password. Upon successful authentication, a corresponding user record in the Sysdig platform’s user database is automatically created. When the LDAP feature is in use, the user’s directory password is not stored in the Sysdig user database. Once LDAP authentication is enabled, all normal user authentication will be performed against your configured directory server. Other local, non-LDAP users that were created before LDAP was enabled can still authenticate via LDAP as long as their username in your directory matches with the username of their pre-existing record in the Sysdig user database. For example, consider a user jdoe@example.com who had been a user in the Sysdig environment before LDAP was enabled. Once LDAP authentication is enabled, if a user jdoe exists in the directory server and is able to authenticate successfully via LDAP, they will be permitted to log in to the Sysdig platform as the pre-existing jdoe@example.com user. Any user-specific configuration (Alerts, Dashboards, etc.) that were attached to jdoe@example.com will still be visible to this user. Any password previously set for such a pre-existing user record will not be used for authentication to the Sysdig platform unless LDAP authentication is disabled. LDAP can be complex to configure. Sysdig strongly recommends that you first refine your LDAP configuration in a separate test setup before applying the LDAP settings in your production environment. Prerequisite: Have the \"Super\" Admin User Credentials and Token In an environment enabled for LDAP authentication, the one user still subject to direct email+password authentication is the \"super\" Admin user . Creation of this user is a required initial install step. You can find the credentials either in the Replicated console (screenshot below) or your Kubernetes ConfigMap element sysdigcloud.default.user . This user is required and cannot be deleted. This login provides: A way to access the Sysdig platform when LDAP connectivity is severed. The first Admin user in the install, essential for assigning Admin rights to other users once they’ve authenticated via your directory and their user records have been added to the Sysdig user database. The user whose token can be used to perform further LDAP configurations. See Retrieve the Sysdig API Security Token for details. Configure Basic LDAP Settings There are two ways to configure the basic LDAP settings for Sysdig: via the Sysdig UI, or via the API endpoint using scripts and HTTP methods. Whichever method is used, it will apply LDAP settings globally, to both Sysdig Monitor and Sysdig Secure. UI-Based: Configure LDAP in Settings At this time, the Authorization UI is available only for Sysdig Monitor. Enter LDAP Connection Settings Log in to Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure as the \"super\" Admin user and select Settings. Select Authentication . Select the LDAP tab. Enter the relevant parameters (see tables below) and click Save . Table_loginConnectionSettings Setting Required Description server Yes URL of the directory server for the Sysdig platform to query. An example for LDAP over SSL: ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:636 For cleartext LDAP: ldap:\/\/176.16.0.1 Note that to use LDAPS, you'll also need to use the Replicated console (or equivalent approach in Kubernetes-based installs ) to upload a Certificate Authority (CA) PEM-format certificate that the Sysdig platform will use to validate its SSL connection to the server. If you have a host with OpenSSL tools installed that can reach the directory server, you can obtain the certificate by running: # openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <server-ip>:636 The command output will typically show the server certificate first and the CA certificate second, both in PEM format. Into a text file, paste the CA certificate portion of the output that looks like: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n[random text...]\n-----END CERTIFICATE----- Under LDAP CA certificate in the PEM format in the Replicated console, click the \"Choose File\" button and browse to the file you just created to select and upload it. Note that when you click Save , the Sysdig platform will restart. This is the only setting related to LDAP that requires a platform restart. Note: For environments using self-signed certificates, the openssl command shown above will return only one certificate. managerDn Yes The distinguished name of a user that the Sysdig platform can authenticate as via LDAP in order to perform further queries about the users attempting to login to the Sysdig platform. Example: cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local This setting is required, as the Sysdig platform does not support connection to servers via anonymous bind. managerPassword Yes The password for the managerDn . rootDn No The distinguished name for the point in the LDAP tree below which all search queries will begin. Example: dc=example,dc=local referral No Defines whether the Sysdig platform will chase referrals found in LDAP query responses. If not specified, this will be set to \"IGNORE\" in your configuration and referrals will not be chased. See the section below on Multi-Server Directories for more details on this option. Table_loginFilter Setting Required Description searchBase Yes A relative distinguished name (from the rootDn ) below which queries about users should be performed. Example: cn=Users If specified as an empty string ( \"\" ), the search will be performed across everything below the rootDn , in which case the rootDn setting must be configured. Note that if the rootDn setting was not specified, the searchBase setting must provide a full distinguished name. Example: cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local searchFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use in constructing the query to identify the user record. The marker token {0} represents where the username will appear when LDAP queries are constructed. An example that targets the attribute sAMAccountName in Active Directory: (&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0})) While this setting is optional, if not specified, no users will be able to authenticate via LDAP. Select LDAP for SSO Select LDAP from the Enabled Single Sign-On dropdown Click Save Authentication . Repeat entire enablement process for Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure, if you want to enable on both applications. Script-Based: Configure LDAP Using Scripts The configuration of the LDAP feature can be viewed, updated, and deleted by the \"super\" Admin via the API endpoint \/api\/admin\/ldap\/settings using HTTP methods for GET , POST , and DELETE , respectively. The workflow is as follows: Log in as super admin (prerequisite ). Retrieve the Sysdig API Security Token (prerequisite) Access login_config.sh and verify_user.sh helper scripts is available in the SSO folder at sysdig-cloud-scripts repository, to assist in completing this configuration. Modify env.sh to enter the API_TOKEN and the URL of your environment. Modify settings_login_simple.json file with LDAP Authentication Configuration (for Platform v.1586)#Table_LoginConnectionSettings and LDAP Authentication Configuration (for Platform v.1586)#Table_loginFilter Settings Execute various scripts # get current settings: initially empty\n.\/login_config.sh\n\n# set settings we have detailed above\n.\/login_config.sh -s settings_login_simple.json\n\n# verify an existing user information is retrieved\n.\/verify_user.sh -u jdoe\n\n# verify a non existing user information is not retrieved\n.\/verify_user.sh -u nothere\n\n# optionally delete the settings\n# .\/login_config.sh -d Consult LDAP Authentication Configuration (for Platform v.1586)#Advanced Use Cases if you have a multi-server environment, or want to create LDAP users before they log in. Details of this workflow are as follows: Configure env.sh To use the helper script, modify the env.sh to set the required values for API_TOKEN and URL for your environment. Once set, invoking login_config.sh (at the sysdig-cloud-scripts repository in GitHub) helper script with no options will print the current configuration. Initially empty. Retrieve Current LDAP Settings # .\/login_config.sh\nNo ldap settings are set\nRun for further info: .\/login_config.sh -h Configure settings_login_simple.json and set withlogin_config.sh In the sysdig-cloud-scripts repository in GitHub, find the example settings_login_simple.json and modify it for your environment, following the Tables above. To apply the new LDAP settings invoke login_config.sh with the -s option and specify the filename containing the JSON config: # .\/login_config.sh -s settings_login_simple.json\n{\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"id\": 1,\n \"version\": 1,\n \"createdOn\": 1547542447000,\n \"type\": \"ldap\",\n \"scope\": \"SYSTEM\",\n \"settings\": {\n \"loginConnectionSettings\": {\n \"server\": \"ldap:\/\/172.16.0.1\",\n \"rootDn\": \"dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"managerDn\": \"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"managerPassword\": \"myMgrPassword\",\n \"referral\": \"IGNORE\"\n },\n \"loginFilter\": {\n \"searchBase\": \"cn=Users\",\n \"searchFilter\": \"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\"\n }\n }\n }\n} Sample result in Active Directory Using the specific example settings_login_simple.json and the minimal Active Directory configuration in the screenshot below, login to the Sysdig platform would now be permitted for a user jdoe that has the following distinguishedName : CN=John Doe,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local Test User Login To test the login configuration, the \"super\" Admin user can confirm if a particular user would be permitted to login given current LDAP login connection settings. To do this, perform an HTTP GET to the API endpoint \/api\/admin\/ldap\/settings\/verify\/USERNAME . A verify_user.sh helper script is provided to easily perform this. If invoked with the -u option and a username, and the user's login would be successful, it will return the user's information from the directory. # .\/verify_user.sh -u jdoe\n{\"element\":\"uSNCreated=12799, countryCode=0, badPwdCount=0, whenChanged=20180406232737.0Z, objectClass=top, primaryGroupID=513, givenName=John, objectGUID=..., objectSid=..., instanceType=4, whenCreated=20180406220651.0Z, dSCorePropagationData=16010101000000.0Z, sn=Doe, userAccountControl=66048, lastLogonTimestamp=131675308573317669, cn=John Doe, codePage=0, accountExpires=9223372036854775807, sAMAccountName=jdoe, sAMAccountType=805306368, userPrincipalName=jdoe@example.local, displayName=John Doe, pwdLastSet=131675260113435098, lastLogon=131682933890462204, name=John Doe, objectCategory=CN=Person,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=example,DC=local, distinguishedName=CN=John Doe,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local, lastLogoff=0, memberOf=CN=Sysdig Viewers,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local, logonCount=0, uSNChanged=12986\"} If the user would not be able to login, an error message will be returned. # .\/verify_user.sh -u nothere\nCould not verify user \"nothere\". Check LDAP login config settings and\/or system log. Note that if LDAP authentication is disabled this method for testing user login is not available. Optional: Delete LDAP settings To delete LDAP settings, invoke login_config.sh with the -d option. After running the following command all LDAP users will not be able to login to the Sysdig platform. # .\/login_config.sh -d\n{\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"id\": 1,\n \"version\": 1,\n \"createdOn\": 1547542447000,\n \"type\": \"ldap\",\n \"scope\": \"SYSTEM\",\n \"settings\": {\n \"loginConnectionSettings\": {\n \"server\": \"ldap:\/\/172.16.0.1\",\n \"rootDn\": \"dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"managerDn\": \"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"managerPassword\": \"myMgrPassword\",\n \"referral\": \"IGNORE\"\n },\n \"loginFilter\": {\n \"searchBase\": \"cn=Users\",\n \"searchFilter\": \"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\"\n }\n }\n }\n} User Experience When a user accesses the Sysdig interface, they are prompted to enter their LDAP credentials (in the fields normally used for email\/password). Monitor: https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/ or Secure: https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/secure Advanced Use Cases Multi-Server Directories Data about your users that need to access the Sysdig platform may be stored across many directory servers in your environment. As the Sysdig platform is only able to query one LDAP server endpoint, you would need to take extra steps to ensure successful authentication for such users. The simplest approach to achieve this is to query against a Global Catalog . As the Global Catalog stores a copy of all Active Directory objects in a forest, this provides a fast and convenient target for the Sysdig platform to find all users that may need to authenticate. Since queries against the Global Catalog are also performed via LDAP, you simply need to ensure your LDAP configuration specifies the appropriate address and TCP port for the Global Catalog, e.g. ldap:\/\/176.16.0.1:3268 for cleartext LDAP or ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:3269 for LDAP over SSL. If querying against a Global Catalog, the referral option of the Sysdig platform's LDAP configuration can remain at its default setting of \"IGNORE\" . If a Global Catalog is not available, another approach is to leverage referral chasing . Such chasing depends on complex interplay of configuration settings, DNS resolution, and network connectivity to multiple servers. If you require this option, carefully read the tips in this section and validate your configuration in a test environment before attempting its use in production. Contact Sysdig support for assistance as necessary. For our example configuration, we've added another Domain Controller to our environment that holds users a separate set of users for the child domain eu.example.local . We'd like to permit login for a user \" eurodude \" in the child domain. This user has distinguishedName : CN=Euro Dude,CN=Users,DC=eu,DC=example,DC=local In the example configuration settings_login_referral_follow.json shown below, the Sysdig platform still begins its LDAP queries at the same top-level server target. However, the referral option is set to \"FOLLOW\" , which will cause the Sysdig platform to perform subsequent queries if a query returns one or more referrals. {\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"settings\": {\n \"loginConnectionSettings\": {\n \"server\": \"ldap:\/\/172.16.0.1\",\n \"managerDn\": \"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"managerPassword\": \"myMgrPassword\",\n \"referral\": \"FOLLOW\"\n },\n \"loginFilter\": {\n \"searchBase\": \"dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"searchFilter\": \"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\"\n }\n },\n \"version\": 1,\n \"type\": \"ldap\"\n }\n} Note also how in this case the rootDn option is left unspecified and the searchBase is set to the distinguished name of the top-level domain. This is necessary to ensure the scope of the chased referral queries will include the child domain. If rootDn and searchBase had been left as they were set in the settings_login_simple.json example, the initial query would have been targeted only within cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local and hence the referral would never have been returned by the top-level server. Note these other caveats of referral chasing in the Sysdig platform: Referrals may only be successfully chased to child domains. If referrals point to parallel domains (e.g. for our example, dc=adjacent,dc=local ) the queries will not succeed and users stored in the directory servers for such domains will not be able to authenticate. The LDAP library used by the Sysdig platform does not log information about each referral it attempts to chase. Therefore, if you enable referral chasing, it is important that you understand the server targets that may be chased in your environment and ensure the network connectivity (routing\/firewalls) will permit the Sysdig platform to query these server targets. If LDAP queries are failing due to a network connectivity issue, this will typically be accompanied by delays during Sysdig user logins of approximately 30 seconds followed by a login failure with an HTTP 504 error message shown in the login screen. If this occurs, contact Sysdig support for assistance. Creating LDAP Users Before They Login The default behavior of the LDAP feature is to create a new record in the Sysdig user database when a user authenticates successfully via LDAP for the first time. However, it may be desirable to add such user records in advance of their first login, such as if you wish to use automation to change user permissions, assign team membership, or pre-populate Dashboard\/Alert configurations. A create_user.sh helper script is available in the sysdig-cloud-scripts repository to create such user records via the API. This script can also be used to enable\/disable this functionality in the Sysdig platform. See the README for details. Additional details regarding this type of user creation in conjunction with LDAP authentication: This method allows creation of any username, even if it doesn't currently exist in the directory that is queried via LDAP. When LDAP authentication is enabled, such users can be created with a simple username (e.g. jdoe ) or with an email-style postfix (as is typical for non-LDAP Sysdig user, e.g. jdoe@example.com ). In this latter case only the username portion ( jdoe ) is used when the Sysdig platform is performing an LDAP query during attempted login. While the password must be included in the config you POST to create the user, it is not used by the Sysdig platform when LDAP is enabled, as authentication will always be performed via LDAP. For this same reason, if a user has been created in this way, they will not be able to login unless there is a matching user in the directory that is queried via LDAP. The firstName and lastName values as specified in the example are optional and independent from any equivalent name settings in the directory that is queried via LDAP. Limitations and Caveats LDAP support has been tested with Active Directory in Windows Server 2012 R2. It may work with AD versions that ship with other versions of Windows, or other directory servers that use the LDAP protocol. If you are intending to use LDAP with something other than Active Directory, please contact Sysdig Support. The LDAP feature is only present in Sysdig software platform installs (not the SaaS version). Only one LDAP config can exist per deployment (i.e. the platform can only query one directory server endpoint). Because the Sysdig software platform is based on the same technology as the SaaS-based Sysdig service, it theoretically supports the configuration of multiple “customers” using the same install. However, the multi-customer option is not supported when the LDAP feature is enabled. When LDAP authentication is enabled, adding users via email \"invites\" is not possible. LDAP authentication for directory usernames that begin or end with a space character (e.g. \" jdoe\" or \"jdoe \" ) are not supported. Configuration entries that contain special characters (for instance, a managerPassword that contains a backslash character) are supported, but note that you will need to perform proper JSON escaping in the configuration you POST to the API. If you attempt to post invalid JSON, the helper scripts will return an error message. If this occurs, you can use tools such as JSONLint to narrow down the source of the problem and\/or JSON String Escape to learn how to properly escape your text. The LDAP feature does not attempt any ongoing “sync” back from the Sysdig platform user database to the directory server. Note how this impacts the following: If a user is deleted from the directory server, their user record will remain in the Sysdig user database until a Sysdig Admin deletes it. Of course, that user will not be able to login since they will no longer be able to authenticate successfully via LDAP. If an Admin deletes a user from the Sysdig user database, but the user can still authenticate successfully via LDAP, their Sysdig user record will be recreated if they login again via LDAP. If a person’s username should change in the directory server (e.g. the value for sAMAccountName in our examples above), the next time they login, a new user record will be created for them in the Sysdig user database. Settings they previously had in the Sysdig platform such as Admin rights and Alerts\/Dashboard configurations will not be present for this recreated user. Other LDAP-centric functionality that is not currently supported (not an exhaustive list): Mapping a user in the directory server to the Sysdig \"super\" Admin (such as to avoid the need to configure the this \"super\" Admin user). Session expiry based on configuration in the directory server (such as to set a user account to only be valid until a certain date). Login policies based on configuration in the directory server (such as to restrict login to certain hours). User timeout functionality (such as to remove a user from the Sysdig user database if they have not logged in for a certain amount of time).

Introduction LDAP support in the Sysdig software platform is often leveraged to allow user authentication using credentials in a customer’s own directory server. This document describes how to configure base LDAP settings, as well as the LDAP Authentication Configuration (for Platform v.1149 - 1511)#limitations of the LDAP support. LDAP can be complex to configure. Sysdig strongly recommends that you first refine your LDAP configuration in a separate test setup before applying the LDAP settings in your production environment. If you do not have a \"development license\" for test purposes or have misplaced your license information, contact billing@sysdig.com. Summary of Functionality Independent of the LDAP feature, the Sysdig platform ordinarily maintains its own user database to hold not only a username and password hash but also settings for Admin privileges, Sysdig team membership, and a user’s configured Dashboards and Alerts. Sysdig's LDAP authentication feature provides a means to allow the Sysdig platform to query your separate directory server to validate username\/password. Upon successful authentication, a corresponding user record in the Sysdig platform’s user database is automatically created. When the LDAP feature is in use, the user’s directory password is not stored in the Sysdig user database. Once LDAP authentication is enabled, all normal user authentication will be performed against your configured directory server. Other local, non-LDAP users that were created before LDAP was enabled can still authenticate via LDAP as long as their username in your directory matches with the the username of their pre-existing record in the Sysdig user database. For example, consider a user jdoe@example.com who had been a user in the Sysdig environment before LDAP was enabled. Once LDAP authentication is enabled, if a user jdoe exists in the directory server and is able to authenticate successfully via LDAP, they will be permitted to log in to the Sysdig platform as the pre-existing jdoe@example.com user. Any user-specific configuration (Alerts, Dashboards, etc.) that were attached to jdoe@example.com will still be visible to this user. Any password previously set for such a pre-existing user record will not be used for authentication to the Sysdig platform unless LDAP authentication is disabled. Upgrades - Migration of Settings Note: This section is only relevant if you have already been using LDAP support as it existed in Sysdig platform version 858 and earlier and are upgrading to version 1149 or newer. If you are configuring LDAP for the first time and are running version 1149 or newer, skip this section. LDAP support in version 858 and older was configured exclusively via the Replicated console or Kubernetes ConfigMap , depending on your installation type. This required the Sysdig platform to be restarted after any changes to the LDAP settings. When you upgrade your environment to version 1149 or newer, your existing settings will be migrated to a new API-based configuration described below. The only LDAP-related setting that remains in the Replicated console is the optional CA certificate for LDAPS connectivity. For Kubernetes-based installs , you should leave the prior LDAP settings intact to ensure successful migration upon upgrade. But once you are successfully running version 1149 or newer, all elements that begin with sysdigcloud.ldap can be removed from your ConfigMap. Prerequisite: The \"Super\" Admin user In an environment enabled for LDAP authentication, the one user still subject to direct email+password authentication is the \"super\" Admin user . Creation of this user is a required initial install step either via the Replicated console (see screenshot below) or Kubernetes ConfigMap element sysdigcloud.default.user . This user is required and cannot be deleted. This login provides: A way to access the Sysdig platform when LDAP connectivity is severed. The first Admin user in the install, essential for assigning Admin rights to other users once they’ve authenticated via your directory and their user records have been added to the Sysdig user database. The user whose REST API Token can be used to perform further LDAP configurations via the Sysdig platform API (see below ). Once other directory-authenticated users have been promoted to Admins, those Admins can promote other directory-authenticated users to Admin, and so on. Configuration of Base LDAP Settings The configuration of the LDAP feature can be viewed, updated, and deleted by the \"super\" Admin via the API endpoint \/api\/admin\/ldap\/settings using HTTP methods for GET , POST , and DELETE , respectively. NOTE : See the REST API page for general info on the API, and the the Locating the \"Super\" Admin User page for guidance on finding the token for the appropriate \"super\" Admin user. A version of a login_config.sh helper script is available in a beta branch of the sysdig-cloud-scripts repository for your use along with an example settings_login_simple.json that can be modified for your environment. Refer to the tables below for details on config options. Example command-lines below the table describe how to enable LDAP with these settings. The follow settings are in the required loginConnectionSettings section. Setting Required Description server Yes URL of the directory server for the Sysdig platform to query. An example for LDAP over SSL: ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:636 For cleartext LDAP: ldap:\/\/176.16.0.1 Note that to use LDAPS, you'll also need to use the Replicated console (or equivalent approach in Kubernetes-based installs ) to upload a Certificate Authority (CA) PEM-format certificate that the Sysdig platform will use to validate its SSL connection to the server. If you have a host with OpenSSL tools installed that can reach the directory server, you can obtain the certificate by running: # openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <server-ip>:636 The command output will typically show the server certificate first and the CA certificate second, both in PEM format. Into a text file, paste the CA certificate portion of the output that looks like: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n[random text...]\n-----END CERTIFICATE----- Under LDAP CA certificate in the PEM format in the Replicated console, click the \"Choose File\" button and browse to the file you just created to select and upload it. Note that when you click Save , the Sysdig platform will restart. This is the only setting related to LDAP that requires a platform restart. Note: For environments using self-signed certificates, the openssl command shown above will return only one certificate. managerDn Yes The distinguished name of a user that the Sysdig platform can authenticate as via LDAP in order to perform further queries about the users attempting to login to the Sysdig platform. Example: cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local This setting is required, as the Sysdig platform does not support connection to servers via anonymous bind. managerPassword Yes The password for the managerDn . rootDn No The distinguished name for the point in the LDAP tree below which all search queries will begin. Example: dc=example,dc=local referral No Defines whether the Sysdig platform will chase referrals found in LDAP query responses. If not specified, this will be set to \"IGNORE\" in your configuration and referrals will not be chased. See the section below on Multi-Server Directories for more details on this option. The following settings are in the optional loginFilter section:s Setting Required Description searchBase Yes A relative distinguished name (from the rootDn ) below which queries about users should be performed. Example: cn=Users If specified as an empty string ( \"\" ), the search will be performed across everything below the rootDn , in which case the rootDn setting must be configured. Note that if the rootDn setting was not specified, the searchBase setting must provide a full distinguished name. Example: cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local searchFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use in constructing the query to identify the user record. The marker token {0} represents where the username will appear when LDAP queries are constructed. An example that targets the attribute sAMAccountName in Active Directory: (&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0})) While this setting is optional, if not specified, no users will be able to authenticate via LDAP. To use the helper script, modify the env.sh to set the required values for API_TOKEN and URL for your environment. Once set, invoking login_config.sh with no options will print the current configuration. If you were running Sysdig platform version 858 or older and have just upgraded to version 1149 or newer, you will see your migrated settings. Otherwise, the LDAP feature will start out disabled ( \"enableLdapAuthentication\": false ) and other configuration settings will not be shown. # .\/login_config.sh\n{\n \"ldapSettings\": {\n \"enableLdapAuthentication\": false,\n \"version\": 1\n }\n} Using the guidance in the settings table above, modify the settings_login_simple.json as necessary to allow for connectivity and querying of users in your directory server. To apply the new LDAP settings, invoke login_config.sh with the -s option and specify the filename containing the JSON config, . If successful, the applied configuration will be echoed back by the API. # .\/login_config.sh -s settings_login_simple.json\n{\"ldapSettings\":{\"version\":2,\"loginConnectionSettings\":{\"server\":\"ldap:\/\/172.16.0.1\",\"rootDn\":\"dc=example,dc=local\",\"managerDn\":\"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\",\"managerPassword\":\"myMgrPassword\",\"referral\":\"IGNORE\"},\"loginFilter\":{\"searchBase\":\"cn=Users\",\"searchFilter\":\"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\"},\"enableLdapAuthentication\":true}} Using the specific example settings_login_simple.json and the minimal Active Directory configuration in the screenshot below, login to the Sysdig platform would now be permitted for a user jdoe that has distinguishedName : CN=John Doe,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local To delete LDAP settings, invoke login_config.sh with the -d option. This should be used with caution, as this will prevent all LDAP users from being able to login to the Sysdig platform! # .\/login_config.sh -d\n{\"ldapSettings\":{\"version\":3,\"enableLdapAuthentication\":false}} Group Membership Configuration (deprecated) The LDAP feature as it existed in version 858 and earlier included optional additional settings that, when specified, ensured that authenticated users were also members of one or more groups before permitting them to login to the Sysdig platform. These settings are documented here for the benefit of those who used these settings in the past and have had their settings migrated to the newer API-based configuration, where they become part of the loginFilter section. See below for details on how to use the searchFilter instead to achieve equivalent functionality. For use with the login_config.sh helper script, an example settings_login_group_deprecated.json is provided that can be modified for your environment based on the table below. Example command-lines are shown below the table. Setting Required Description groupSearchBase No A relative distinguished name (from the rootDn ) below which queries about groups should be performed. Example: ou=Planets groupSearchFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use in constructing the query to identify a group to which the user must belong. An example that only permits users that are in the Mars group in Active Directory: (&(cn=Mars)(objectclass=group)) If this setting is left blank, group membership is not required, and hence any user that successfully authenticates via LDAP using only username\/password will be permitted to login to the Sysdig platform. groupMembershipFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use to determine group membership. If no setting is specified, the following default filter is applied, which should work for most environments: (| (member={0}) (uniqueMember={0}) (memberUid={1})) Using the specific example settings_login_group_deprecated.json and the minimal Active Directory configuration in the screenshot below, login to the Sysdig platform would be permitted for this user who belongs to the Mars group. But our jdoe user who is not a member would be prevented from logging in. To simplify your configuration and avoid use of these deprecated options, an equivalent configuration can be achieved by making the group membership part of the searchFilter : \"searchFilter\": \"(&(memberOf=CN=Mars,OU=Planets,DC=example,DC=local)(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\" See the example settings_login_group.json for an updated configuration that can be compared side-by-side with settings_login_group_deprecated.json . Multi-Server Directories Data about your users that need to access the Sysdig platform may be stored across many directory servers in your environment. As the Sysdig platform is only able to query one LDAP server endpoint, you would need to take extra steps to ensure successful authentication for such users. The simplest approach to achieve this is to query against a Global Catalog . As the Global Catalog stores a copy of all Active Directory objects in a forest, this provides a fast and convenient target for the Sysdig platform to find all users that may need to authenticate. Since queries against the Global Catalog are also performed via LDAP, you simply need to ensure your LDAP configuration specifies the appropriate address and TCP port for the Global Catalog, e.g. ldap:\/\/176.16.0.1:3268 for cleartext LDAP or ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:3269 for LDAP over SSL. If querying against a Global Catalog, the referral option of the Sysdig platform's LDAP configuration can remain at its default setting of \"IGNORE\" . If a Global Catalog is not available, another approach is to leverage referral chasing . Such chasing depends on complex interplay of configuration settings, DNS resolution, and network connectivity to multiple servers. If you require this option, carefully read the tips in this section and validate your configuration in a test environment before attempting its use in production. Contact Sysdig support for assistance as necessary. For our example configuration, we've added another Domain Controller to our environment that holds users a separate set of users for the child domain eu.example.local . We'd like to permit login for a user \" eurodude \" in the child domain. This user has distinguishedName : CN=Euro Dude,CN=Users,DC=eu,DC=example,DC=local In the example configuration settings_login_referral_follow.json shown below, the Sysdig platform still begins its LDAP queries at the same top-level server target. However, the referral option is set to \"FOLLOW\" , which will cause the Sysdig platform to perform subsequent queries if a query returns one or more referrals. {\n \"loginConnectionSettings\": {\n \"server\": \"ldap:\/\/172.16.0.1\",\n \"managerDn\": \"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"managerPassword\": \"myMgrPassword\",\n \"referral\": \"FOLLOW\"\n },\n \"loginFilter\": {\n \"searchBase\": \"dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"searchFilter\": \"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\"\n },\n \"enableLdapAuthentication\": true\n} Note also how in this case the rootDn option is left unspecified and the searchBase is set to the distinguished name of the top-level domain. This is necessary to ensure the scope of the chased referral queries will include the child domain. If rootDn and searchBase had been left as they were set in the settings_login_simple.json example, the initial query would have been targeted only within cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local and hence the referral would never have been returned by the top-level server. Note these other caveats of referral chasing in the Sysdig platform: Referrals may only be successfully chased to child domains. If referrals point to parallel domains (e.g. for our example, dc=adjacent,dc=local ) the queries will not succeed and users stored in the directory servers for such domains will not be able to authenticate. The LDAP library used by the Sysdig platform does not log information about each referral it attempts to chase. Therefore, if you enable referral chasing, it is important that you understand the server targets that may be chased in your environment and ensure the network connectivity (routing\/firewalls) will permit the Sysdig platform to query these server targets. If LDAP queries are failing due to a network connectivity issue, this will typically be accompanied by delays during Sysdig user logins of approximately 30 seconds followed by a login failure with an HTTP 504 error message shown in the login screen. If this occurs, contact Sysdig support for assistance. Testing User Login To test the login configuration, the \"super\" Admin user can confirm if a particular user would be permitted to login given current LDAP login connection settings. To do this, perform an HTTP GET to the API endpoint \/api\/admin\/ldap\/settings\/verify\/USERNAME . A verify_user.sh helper script is provided to easily perform this. If invoked with the -u option and a username, and the user's login would be successful, it will return the user's information from the directory. # .\/verify_user.sh -u jdoe\n{\"element\":\"uSNCreated=12799, countryCode=0, badPwdCount=0, whenChanged=20180406232737.0Z, objectClass=top, primaryGroupID=513, givenName=John, objectGUID=..., objectSid=..., instanceType=4, whenCreated=20180406220651.0Z, dSCorePropagationData=16010101000000.0Z, sn=Doe, userAccountControl=66048, lastLogonTimestamp=131675308573317669, cn=John Doe, codePage=0, accountExpires=9223372036854775807, sAMAccountName=jdoe, sAMAccountType=805306368, userPrincipalName=jdoe@example.local, displayName=John Doe, pwdLastSet=131675260113435098, lastLogon=131682933890462204, name=John Doe, objectCategory=CN=Person,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=example,DC=local, distinguishedName=CN=John Doe,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local, lastLogoff=0, memberOf=CN=Sysdig Viewers,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local, logonCount=0, uSNChanged=12986\"} If the user would not be able to login, an error message will be returned. # .\/verify_user.sh -u nothere\nCould not verify user \"nothere\". Check LDAP login config settings and\/or system log. Note that if LDAP authentication is disabled this method for testing user login is not available. Creating LDAP Users Before They Login The default behavior of the LDAP feature is to create a new record in the Sysdig user database when a user authenticates successfully via LDAP for the first time. However, it may be desirable to add such user records in advance of their first login, such as if you wish to use automation to change user permissions, assign team membership, or pre-populate Dashboard\/Alert configurations. A create_user.sh helper script is available in the sysdig-cloud-scripts repository to create such user records via the API. This script can also be used to enable\/disable this functionality in the Sysdig platform. See the README for details. Additional details regarding this type of user creation in conjunction with LDAP authentication: This method allows creation of any username, even if it doesn't currently exist in the directory that is queried via LDAP. When LDAP authentication is enabled, such users can be created with a simple username (e.g. jdoe ) or with an email-style postfix (as is typical for non-LDAP Sysdig user, e.g. jdoe@example.com ). In this latter case only the username portion ( jdoe ) is used when the Sysdig platform is performing an LDAP query during attempted login. While the password must be included in the config you POST to create the user, it is not used by the Sysdig platform when LDAP is enabled, as authentication will always be performed via LDAP. For this same reason, if a user has been created in this way, they will not be able to login unless there is a matching user in the directory that is queried via LDAP. The firstName and lastName values as specified in the example are optional and independent from any equivalent name settings in the directory that is queried via LDAP. Limitations and Caveats LDAP support has been tested with Active Directory in Windows Server 2012 R2. It may work with AD versions that ship with other versions of Windows, or other directory servers that use the LDAP protocol. If you are intending to use LDAP with something other than Active Directory, please contact Sysdig Support. The LDAP feature is only present in Sysdig software platform installs (not the SaaS version). Only one LDAP config can exist per deployment (i.e. the platform can only query one directory server endpoint). Because the Sysdig software platform is based on the same technology as the SaaS-based Sysdig service, it theoretically supports the configuration of multiple “customers” using the same install. However, the multi-customer option is not supported when the LDAP feature is enabled. When LDAP authentication is enabled, adding users via email \"invites\" is not possible. LDAP authentication for directory usernames that begin or end with a space character (e.g. \" jdoe\" or \"jdoe \" ) are not supported. Configuration entries that contain special characters (for instance, a managerPassword that contains a backslash character) are supported, but note that you will need to perform proper JSON escaping in the configuration you POST to the API. If you attempt to post invalid JSON, the helper scripts will return an error message. If this occurs, you can use tools such as JSONLint to narrow down the source of the problem and\/or JSON String Escape to learn how to properly escape your text. The LDAP feature does not attempt any ongoing “sync” back from the Sysdig platform user database to the directory server. Note how this impacts the following: If a user is deleted from the directory server, their user record will remain in the Sysdig user database until a Sysdig Admin deletes it. Of course, that user will not be able to login since they will no longer be able to authenticate successfully via LDAP. If an Admin deletes a user from the Sysdig user database, but the user can still authenticate successfully via LDAP, their Sysdig user record will be recreated if they login again via LDAP. If a person’s username should change in the directory server (e.g. the value for sAMAccountName in our examples above), the next time they login, a new user record will be created for them in the Sysdig user database. Settings they previously had in the Sysdig platform such as Admin rights and Alerts\/Dashboard configurations will not be present for this recreated user. Other LDAP-centric functionality that is not currently supported (not an exhaustive list): Mapping a user in the directory server to the Sysdig \"super\" Admin (such as to avoid the need to configure the this \"super\" Admin user). Session expiry based on configuration in the directory server (such as to set a user account to only be valid until a certain date). Login policies based on configuration in the directory server (such as to restrict login to certain hours). User timeout functionality (such as to remove a user from the Sysdig user database if they have not logged in for a certain amount of time).

If you are running version 858 or older, refer to this other article instead. If you are running versions 890 through 925, refer to this other article instead. Introduction LDAP support in the Sysdig software platform allows user authentication using credentials in a customer’s own directory server. This document describes how to configure LDAP authentication as well as its LDAP Authentication Configuration (for Platform v. 963 - 1091)#limitations . LDAP can be complex to configure. Sysdig strongly recommends that you first refine your LDAP configuration in a separate test setup before applying the LDAP settings in your production environment. If you do not have a \"development license\" for test purposes or have misplaced your license information, contact billing@sysdig.com. Summary of Functionality Independent of the LDAP feature, the Sysdig platform ordinarily maintains its own user database to hold not only a username and password hash but also settings for Admin privileges, Sysdig team membership, and a user’s configured Dashboards and Alerts. The LDAP feature provides a means to allow the Sysdig platform to query your separate directory server to validate username\/password. Upon successful authentication, a corresponding user record in the Sysdig platform’s user database is automatically created. When the LDAP feature is in use, the user’s directory password is not stored in the Sysdig user database. Once the LDAP feature is enabled, all normal user authentication will be performed against your configured directory server. Other local, non-LDAP users that were created before LDAP was enabled can still authenticate via LDAP as long as the username portion of their email address in the Sysdig user database matches their LDAP username. For example, consider a user jdoe@example.com who had been a user in the Sysdig environment before LDAP was enabled. Once LDAP is enabled, if a user jdoe exists in the directory server and is able to authenticate successfully via LDAP, they will be permitted to log in to the Sysdig platform as the pre-existing jdoe@example.com user. Any user-specific configuration (Alerts, Dashboards, etc.) that were attached to jdoe@example.com will still be visible to this user. Any password previously set for such a pre-existing user record will not be used for authentication to the Sysdig platform unless the LDAP feature is disabled. Upgrades - Migration of Settings Note: This section is only relevant if you have already been using LDAP support as it existed in Sysdig platform version 858 and earlier and are upgrading to version 963 or newer. If you are configuring LDAP for the first time and are running version 963 or newer, skip this section. LDAP support in version 858 and older (as described in this article ) was configured exclusively via the Replicated console or Kubernetes ConfigMap , depending on your installation type. This required the Sysdig platform to be restarted after any changes to the LDAP settings. When you upgrade your environment to version 963 or newer, your existing settings will be migrated to a new API-based configuration described below. The only LDAP-related setting that remains in the Replicated console is the optional CA certificate for LDAPS connectivity. For Kubernetes -based installs , you should leave the prior LDAP settings intact to ensure successful migration upon upgrade. But once you are successfully running version 963 or newer, all elements that begin with sysdigcloud.ldap can be removed from your ConfigMap. Prerequisite: The \"Super\" Admin user In an LDAP-enabled environment, the one user still subject to direct, non-LDAP authentication is the \"super\" Admin user . Creation of this user is a required initial install step either via the Replicated console (see screenshot below) or Kubernetes ConfigMap element sysdigcloud.default.user . This user is required and cannot be deleted. This login provides: A way to access the Sysdig platform when LDAP connectivity is severed. The first Admin user in the install, essential for assigning Admin rights to other users once they’ve authenticated via LDAP and their user records have been added to the Sysdig user database. The user whose REST API Token can be used to perform further LDAP configurations via the Sysdig platform API (see below ). Once other LDAP-authenticated users have been promoted to Admins, those Admins can promote other LDAP-authenticated users to Admin, and so on. Configuration of LDAP Authentication The configuration of the LDAP feature can be viewed, updated, and deleted by the \"super\" Admin via the API endpoint \/api\/admin\/ldap\/settings using HTTP methods for GET , POST , and DELETE , respectively. NOTE : See the REST API page for general info on the API, and the the Locating the \"Super\" Admin User page for guidance on finding the token for the appropriate \"super\" Admin user. A login_config.sh helper script is available in the sysdig-cloud-scripts repository for your use along with an example settings_login_simple.json that can be modified for your environment. Refer to the table below for details on config options. Example command-lines below the table describe how to enable LDAP with these settings. Section Setting Required Description loginConnectionSettings server Yes URL of the directory server for the Sysdig platform to query. An example for cleartext LDAP: ldap:\/\/176.16.0.1 For LDAP over SSL\/TLS: ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:636 Note that to use LDAPS, you'll also need to use the Replicated console (or equivalent approach in Kubernetes -based installs ) to upload a Certificate Authority (CA) PEM-format certificate that the Sysdig platform will use to validate its SSL\/TLS connection to the server. If you have a host with OpenSSL tools installed that can reach the directory server, you can obtain the certificate by running: # openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <server-ip>:636 The command output will typically show the server certificate first and the CA certificate second, both in PEM format. Into a text file, paste the CA certificate portion of the output that looks like: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n[random text...]\n-----END CERTIFICATE----- Under LDAP CA certificate in the PEM format in the Replicated console, click the \"Choose File\" button and browse to the file you just created to select and upload it. Note that when you click Save , the Sysdig platform will restart. This is the only setting related to LDAP that requires a platform restart. Note: For environments using self-signed certificates, the openssl command shown above will return only one certificate. loginConnectionSettings managerDn Yes The distinguished name of a user that the Sysdig platform can authenticate as via LDAP in order to perform further queries about the users attempting to login to the Sysdig platform. Example: cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local This setting is required, as the Sysdig platform does not support connection to servers via anonymous bind. loginConnectionSettings managerPassword Yes The password for the managerDn . loginConnectionSettings rootDn No The distinguished name for the point in the LDAP tree below which all search queries will begin. Example: dc=example,dc=local loginConnectionSettings referral No Defines whether the Sysdig platform will chase referrals found in LDAP query responses. If not specified, this will be set to \"IGNORE\" in your configuration and referrals will not be chased. See the section below on Multi-Server Directories for more details on this option. loginFilter searchBase Yes A relative distinguished name (from the rootDn ) below which queries about users will be performed. Example: cn=Users If specified as an empty string ( \"\" ), the search will be performed across everything below the rootDn , in which case the rootDn setting must be configured. Note that if the rootDn setting was not specified, the searchBase setting must provide a full distinguished name. Example: cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local loginFilter searchFilter Yes An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use in constructing the query to identify the user record. The marker token {0} represents where the provided username will be placed when LDAP queries are constructed. An example that targets the attribute sAMAccountName in Active Directory: (&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0})) To use the helper script, modify the env.sh to set the required values for API_TOKEN and URL for your environment. Once set, invoking login_config.sh with no options will print the current configuration. If you were running Sysdig platform version 858 or older and have just upgraded to version 925 or newer, you will see your migrated settings. Otherwise, the LDAP feature will start out disabled ( \"enableLdapAuthentication\": false ) and other configuration settings will not be shown. # .\/login_config.sh\n{\n \"ldapSettings\": {\n \"enableLdapAuthentication\": false,\n \"version\": 1\n }\n} Using the guidance in the settings table above, modify the settings_login_simple.json as necessary to allow for connectivity and querying of users in your directory server. To apply the new LDAP settings, invoke login_config.sh with the -s option and specify the filename containing the JSON config, . If successful, the applied configuration will be echoed back by the API. # .\/login_config.sh -s settings_login_simple.json\n{\"ldapSettings\":{\"version\":2,\"loginConnectionSettings\":{\"server\":\"ldap:\/\/172.16.0.1\",\"rootDn\":\"dc=example,dc=local\",\"managerDn\":\"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\",\"managerPassword\":\"myMgrPassword\",\"referral\":\"IGNORE\"},\"loginFilter\":{\"searchBase\":\"cn=Users\",\"searchFilter\":\"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\"},\"enableLdapAuthentication\":true,\"allowApiUserCreation\":false}} Using the specific example settings_login_simple.json and the minimal Active Directory configuration in the screenshot below, login to the Sysdig platform would now be permitted for a user jdoe that has distinguishedName : CN=John Doe,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local To delete LDAP settings, invoke login_config.sh with the -d option. This should be used with caution, as this will prevent all LDAP users from being able to login to the Sysdig platform! # .\/login_config.sh -d\n{\"ldapSettings\":{\"version\":3,\"enableLdapAuthentication\":false}} Group Membership Configuration (deprecated) The LDAP feature as it existed in version 858 and earlier included optional additional settings that, when specified, ensured that authenticated users were also members of one or more groups before permitting them to login to the Sysdig platform. These settings are documented here for the benefit of those who used these settings in the past and have had their settings migrated to the newer API-based configuration. See below for details on how to use the searchFilter instead to achieve equivalent functionality. For use with the login_config.sh helper script, an example settings_login_group_deprecated.json is provided that can be modified for your environment based on the table below. Example command-lines are shown below the table. Section Setting Required Description loginFilter groupSearchBase No A relative distinguished name (from the rootDn ) below which queries about groups should be performed. Example: ou=Planets loginFilter groupSearchFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use in constructing the query to identify a group to which the user must belong. An example that only permits users that are in the Mars group in Active Directory: (&(cn=Mars)(objectclass=group)) If this setting is left blank, group membership is not required, and hence any user that successfully authenticates via LDAP using only username\/password will be permitted to login to the Sysdig platform. loginFilter groupMembershipFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use to determine group membership. If no setting is specified, the following default filter is applied, which should work for most environments: (| (member={0}) (uniqueMember={0}) (memberUid={1})) Using the specific example settings_login_group_deprecated.json and the minimal Active Directory configuration in the screenshot below, login to the Sysdig platform would be permitted for this user who belongs to the Mars group. But our previous jdoe user who is not a member would be prevented from logging in. To simplify your configuration and avoid use of these deprecated options, an equivalent configuration can be achieved by making the group membership part of the searchFilter : \"searchFilter\": \"(&(memberOf=CN=Mars,OU=Planets,DC=example,DC=local)(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\" See the example settings_login_group.json for an updated configuration that can be compared side-by-side with settings_login_group_deprecated.json .

We'd like to permit login for a user \" eurodude \" in the child domain. This user has distinguishedName : CN=Euro Dude,CN=Users,DC=eu,DC=example,DC=local In the example configuration settings_login_referral_follow.json shown below, the Sysdig platform still begins its LDAP queries at the same top-level server target.

Configuration entries that contain special characters (for instance, a managerPassword that contains a backslash character) are supported, but note that you will need to perform proper JSON escaping in the configuration you POST to the API. If you attempt to post invalid JSON, the helper scripts will return an error message. If this occurs, you can use tools such as JSONLint to narrow down the source of the problem and\/or JSON String Escape to learn how to properly escape your text. The LDAP feature does not attempt any ongoing “sync” back from the Sysdig platform user database to the directory server. Note how this impacts the following: If a user is deleted from the directory server, their user record will remain in the Sysdig user database until a Sysdig Admin deletes it. Of course, that user will not be able to login since they will no longer be able to authenticate successfully via LDAP. If an Admin deletes a user from the Sysdig user database, but the user can still authenticate successfully via LDAP, their Sysdig user record will be recreated if they login again via LDAP. If a person’s username should change in the directory server (e.g. the value for sAMAccountName in our examples above), the next time they login, a new user record will be created for them in the Sysdig user database. Settings they previously had in the Sysdig platform such as Admin rights and Alerts\/Dashboard configurations will not be present for this recreated user. Other LDAP-centric functionality that is not currently supported (not an exhaustive list): Mapping a user in the directory server to the Sysdig \"super\" Admin (such as to avoid the need to configure the this \"super\" Admin user). Session expiry based on configuration in the directory server (such as to set a user account to only be valid until a certain date). Login policies based on configuration in the directory server (such as to restrict login to certain hours). User timeout functionality (such as to remove a user from the Sysdig user database if they have not logged in for a certain amount of time).

If you are running version 858 or older, refer to this other article instead. If you are running version 963 or newer, refer to this other article instead. Introduction LDAP support in the Sysdig software platform allows user authentication using credentials in a customer’s own directory server. This document describes how to configure LDAP authentication as well as its limitations . LDAP can be complex to configure. Sysdig strongly recommends that you first refine your LDAP configuration in a separate test setup before applying the LDAP settings in your production environment. If you do not have a \"development license\" for test purposes or have misplaced your license information, contact billing@sysdig.com. Summary of Functionality Independent of the LDAP feature, the Sysdig platform ordinarily maintains its own user database to hold not only a username and password hash but also settings for Admin privileges, Sysdig team membership, and a user’s configured Dashboards and Alerts. The LDAP feature provides a means to allow the Sysdig platform to query your separate directory server to validate username\/password. Upon successful authentication, a corresponding user record in the Sysdig platform’s user database is automatically created. When the LDAP feature is in use, the user’s directory password is not stored in the Sysdig user database. Upgrades - Migration of Settings Note: This section is only relevant if you have already been using LDAP support as it existed in Sysdig platform version 858 and earlier and are upgrading to version 890 or newer. If you are configuring LDAP for the first time and are running version 890 or newer, skip this section. LDAP support in version 858 and older (as described in this article ) was configured exclusively via the Replicated console or K8S ConfigMap , depending on your installation type. This required the Sysdig platform to be restarted after any changes to the LDAP settings. When you upgrade your environment to version 890 or newer, your existing settings will be migrated to a new API-based configuration described below. The only LDAP-related settings that remain in the Replicated console are those to Enable LDAP and to upload the optional CA certificate for LDAPS connectivity. For K8S-based installs, you should leave the LDAP settings intact to ensure successful migration upon upgrade, but once running version 890 or newer, only sysdigcloud.ldap.enabled will be used and the other settings can be removed from your ConfigMap. Configuration of LDAP Authentication Enabling the LDAP Feature Depending on your type of software install, the LDAP feature is enabled through the Replicated console or K8S configuration . This article will focus on the Replicated option. LDAP is disabled by default and once LDAP is enabled, it cannot be disabled . To enable LDAP, first click the checkbox at the bottom of the Settings tab to expand the Advanced Settings . Then click the checkbox at the bottom of the newly-opened section to Enable LDAP . The CA certificate is optional and only needed if you intend to use LDAPS (see the section below on loginConnectionSettings → server ). At this point if you click Save , the Sysdig platform will restart and further LDAP settings can be configured via the Sysdig Admin API (see below ). In addition to the LDAP-specific sections of the Settings page, note that the Default user settings near the top of the page are also still required. This represents the The \"super\" Admin user that will still login using an email address, bypassing LDAP. This user is required and cannot be deleted. This login provides: A way to access the Sysdig platform when LDAP connectivity is severed. The first Admin user in the install, essential for assigning Admin rights to other users once they’ve authenticated via LDAP and their user records have been added to the Sysdig user database. The user whose REST API Token can be used to perform further LDAP configurations via the Sysdig platform API (see below ). Once other LDAP-authenticated users have been promoted to Admins, those Admins can promote other LDAP-authenticated users to Admin, and so on. Other local, non-LDAP users that were created before LDAP was enabled can still authenticate via LDAP as long as the username portion of their email address in the Sysdig user database matches their LDAP username. For example, consider a user jdoe@example.com who had been a user in the environment before LDAP was enabled. Once LDAP is enabled, if a user jdoe exists in the directory server and is able to authenticate successfully via LDAP, they will be permitted to log in to the Sysdig platform as the pre-existing jdoe@example.com user. Any user-specific configuration (Alerts, Dashboards, etc.) that were attached to jdoe@example.com will still be visible to this user. Further LDAP Configuration Via API Once the LDAP feature is enabled, the \"super\" Admin user can view, update, and delete LDAP settings via the API endpoint \/api\/admin\/ldap\/settings using HTTP methods for GET , POST , and DELETE , respectively. NOTE : See the REST API page for general info on the API, and the the Locating the \"Super\" Admin User page for guidance on finding the token for the appropriate \"super\" Admin user. A login_config helper script is available in a branch of the sysdig-cloud-scripts repository for your use along with an example settings_login_simple.json that can be modified for your environment. Refer to the table below for details on config options. Example command-lines are shown below the table. Section Setting Required Description loginConnectionSettings server Yes URL of the directory server for the Sysdig platform to query. An example for LDAP over SSL\/TLS: ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:636 For cleartext LDAP: ldap:\/\/176.16.0.1 Note that to use LDAPS, you'll also need to use the Replicated console to upload a Certificate Authority (CA) PEM-format certificate that the Sysdig platform will use to validate its SSL\/TLS connection to the server. If you have a host with OpenSSL tools installed that can reach the directory server, you can obtain the certificate by running: # openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <server-ip>:636 The command output will typically show the server certificate first and the CA certificate second, both in PEM format. Into a text file, paste the CA certificate portion of the output that looks like: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n[random text...]\n-----END CERTIFICATE----- Under CA certificate in the PEM format in the Replicated console, click the \"Choose File\" button and browse to the file you just created to select and upload it. Note that when you click Save , the Sysdig platform will restart. Note: For environments using self-signed certificates, the openssl command shown above will return only one certificate. loginConnectionSettings managerDn Yes The distinguished name of a user that the Sysdig platform can authenticate as via LDAP in order to perform further queries about the users attempting to login to the Sysdig platform. Example: cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local This setting is required, as the Sysdig platform does not support connection to servers via anonymous bind. loginConnectionSettings managerPassword Yes The password for the managerDn . loginConnectionSettings rootDn Yes The distinguished name for the point in the LDAP tree below which all search queries will begin. Example: dc=example,dc=local loginFilter searchBase No A relative distinguished name (from the rootDn ) below which queries about users should be performed. If not specified, the search will be performed across everything below the rootDn . Example: cn=Users loginFilter searchFilter Yes An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use in constructing the query to identify the user record. The marker token {0} represents where the username will appear when LDAP queries are constructed. An example that targets the attribute sAMAccountName in Active Directory: (&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0})) To use the helper script, modify the env.sh to set the required values for API_TOKEN and URL for your environment. Once set, invoking login_config with no options will print the current configuration. If you were running Sysdig platform version 858 or older and have just upgraded to version 890 or newer, you will see your migrated settings. Otherwise the config will start out empty: # .\/login_config\n{\n \"ldapSettings\": {\n \"allowApiUserCreation\": false,\n \"version\": 1\n }\n} To apply new LDAP settings, invoke login_config with the -s option and specify the filename containing the JSON config. If successful, the applied configuration will be echoed back by the API. # .\/login_config -s settings_login_simple.json\n{\"ldapSettings\":{\"version\":2,\"loginConnectionSettings\":{\"server\":\"ldap:\/\/172.16.0.1\",\"rootDn\":\"dc=example,dc=local\",\"managerDn\":\"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\",\"managerPassword\":\"myMgrPassword\"},\"loginFilter\":{\"searchBase\":\"cn=Users\",\"searchFilter\":\"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\",\"groupSearchBase\":\"\",\"groupSearchFilter\":\"\",\"groupMembershipFilter\":\"\"},\"allowApiUserCreation\":false}} Using the specific example settings_login_simple.json and the minimal Active Directory configuration in the screenshot below, login to the Sysdig platform would be permitted for a user jdoe that has distinguishedName : CN=John Doe,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local To delete LDAP settings, invoke login_config with the -d option. This should be used with caution, as this will prevent all LDAP users from being able to login to the Sysdig platform! # .\/login_config -d\n{\"ldapSettings\":{\"version\":3,\"allowApiUserCreation\":false}} Group Membership Configuration (deprecated) The LDAP feature as it existed in version 858 and earlier included optional additional settings that, when specified, ensured that authenticated users were also members of one or more groups before permitting them to login to the Sysdig platform. These settings are documented here for the benefit of those who used these settings in the past and have had their settings migrated to the newer API-based configuration. See below for details on how to use the searchFilter instead to achieve equivalent functionality. For use with the login_config helper script, an example settings_login_group_deprecated.json is provided that can be modified for your environment based on the table below. Example command-lines are shown below the table. Section Setting Required Description loginFilter groupSearchBase No A relative distinguished name (from the rootDn ) below which queries about groups should be performed. Example: ou=Planets loginFilter groupSearchFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use in constructing the query to identify a group to which the user must belong. An example that only permits users that are in the Mars group in Active Directory: (&(cn=Mars)(objectclass=group)) If this setting is left blank, group membership is not required, and hence any user that successfully authenticates via LDAP using only username\/password will be permitted to login to the Sysdig platform. loginFilter groupMembershipFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use to determine group membership. If no setting is specified, the following default filter is applied, which should work for most environments: (| (member={0}) (uniqueMember={0}) (memberUid={1})) Using the specific example settings_login_group_deprecated.json and the minimal Active Directory configuration in the screenshot below, login to the Sysdig platform would be permitted for this user who belongs to the Mars group. But our previous jdoe user who is not a member would be prevented from logging in. To simplify your configuration and avoid use of these deprecated options, an equivalent configuration can be achieved by making the group membership part of the searchFilter : \"searchFilter\": \"(&(memberOf=CN=Mars,OU=Planets,DC=example,DC=local)(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\" See the example settings_login_group.json for an updated configuration that can be compared side-by-side with settings_login_group_deprecated.json . Testing User Login To test the login configuration, the \"super\" Admin user can confirm if a particular user would be permitted to login given current LDAP login connection settings. To do this, perform an HTTP GET to the API endpoint \/api\/admin\/ldap\/settings\/verify\/USERNAME . A verify_user helper script is provided to easily perform this. If invoked with the -u option and a username, and the user's login would be successful, it will return the user's information from the directory. # .\/verify_user -u jdoe\n{\"element\":\"uSNCreated=12799, countryCode=0, badPwdCount=0, whenChanged=20180406232737.0Z, objectClass=top, primaryGroupID=513, givenName=John, objectGUID=..., objectSid=..., instanceType=4, whenCreated=20180406220651.0Z, dSCorePropagationData=16010101000000.0Z, sn=Doe, userAccountControl=66048, lastLogonTimestamp=131675308573317669, cn=John Doe, codePage=0, accountExpires=9223372036854775807, sAMAccountName=jdoe, sAMAccountType=805306368, userPrincipalName=jdoe@example.local, displayName=John Doe, pwdLastSet=131675260113435098, lastLogon=131682933890462204, name=John Doe, objectCategory=CN=Person,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=example,DC=local, distinguishedName=CN=John Doe,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local, lastLogoff=0, memberOf=CN=Sysdig Viewers,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local, logonCount=0, uSNChanged=12986\"} If the user would not be able to login, an error message will be returned. # .\/verify_user -u nothere\nCould not verify user \"nothere\". Check LDAP login config settings and\/or system log. Creating LDAP Users Before They Login The default behavior of the LDAP feature is to create a new record in the Sysdig user database when a user authenticates successfully via LDAP for the first time. However, it may be desirable to add such user records in advance of their first login, such as if you wish to use automation to change user permissions, assign team membership, or pre-populate Dashboard\/Alert configurations. To enable this option, POST the following top-level config element to \/api\/admin\/ldap\/settings with your other LDAP settings. A complete example config including this element is provided at settings_login_with_user_create.json . \"allowApiUserCreation\": true Once this option is enabled, to create a user, invoke the provided helper script create_user , with the -s option and specify a filename containing user information, such as the provided example settings_user_create.json . If successful, details about the created user record will be echoed back by the API. # .\/create_user -s settings_user_create.json\n{\"user\":{\"id\":7,\"version\":0,\"username\":\"msmith\",\"enabled\":true,\"firstName\":\"Mary\",\"lastName\":\"Smith\",\"status\":\"confirmed\",\"termsAndConditions\":true,\"pictureUrl\":\"http:\/\/www.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6b17d2b356172c9966690ce93f66e8dd\",\"dateActivated\":1523405703283,\"properties\":{},\"customerSettings\":{\"sysdig\":{\"enabled\":false,\"buckets\":[]},\"plan\":{\"maxAgents\":1000,\"onDemandAgents\":0,\"maxTeams\":-1,\"timelines\":[{\"from\":null,\"to\":null,\"sampling\":10000000},{\"from\":null,\"to\":null,\"sampling\":60000000},{\"from\":null,\"to\":null,\"sampling\":600000000},{\"from\":null,\"to\":null,\"sampling\":3600000000},{\"from\":null,\"to\":null,\"sampling\":86400000000}],\"metricsSettings\":{\"enforce\":false,\"limits\":{\"jmx\":200,\"statsd\":200,\"appCheck\":200,\"prometheus\":200,\"progAggregationCount\":12}},\"secureEnabled\":false,\"allocatedAgentsCount\":1000,\"paymentsIntegrationId\":{\"id\":\"not migrated\",\"ttl\":{\"ttl\":50}},\"pricingPlan\":\"basic\",\"overageAssessmentEligible\":false}},\"customer\":{\"id\":1,\"version\":0,\"name\":\"\",\"accessKey\":\"1ca2a53d-e102-46a2-aec7-851426ce3c61\",\"lastUpdated\":1523391582000,\"dateCreated\":1523391582000},\"timezone\":\"+00:00\",\"systemRole\":\"ROLE_USER\",\"agentInstallParams\":{\"collectorAddress\":\"172.31.6.227\",\"accessKey\":\"1ca2a53d-e102-46a2-aec7-851426ce3c61\",\"collectorPort\":6443,\"checkCertificate\":true},\"oauth\":false,\"resetPassword\":false,\"accessKey\":\"1ca2a53d-e102-46a2-aec7-851426ce3c61\",\"dateCreated\":1523405703311,\"teamRoles\":[{\"userId\":7,\"teamId\":1,\"role\":\"ROLE_TEAM_EDIT\"}]}} Additional details regarding this type of user creation: The customer id of 1 specified in the example is typical for most Sysdig software platform installations, but may be different (rarely) in some enviornments. See this article for info on how to confirm. This method allows creation of any user, even if it doesn't actually exist in the directory that is queried via LDAP. Such users can be created with a simple username (e.g. jdoe ) or with an email-style postfix (as is typical for non-LDAP Sysdig user, e.g. jdoe@example.com ). In this latter case only the username portion ( jdoe ) is used when the Sysdig platform is performing an LDAP query during attempted login. While the password must be included in the config you POST to create the user, it is not used by the Sysdig platform, as authentication will always be performed via LDAP. For this same reason, if a user has been created in this way, they will not be able to login unless there is a matching user in the directory that is queried via LDAP. The firstName and lastName values as specified in the example are optional and independent from any equivalent name settings in the directory that is queried via LDAP. Limitations and Caveats LDAP support has been tested with Active Directory in Windows Server 2012 R2. It may work with AD versions that ship with other versions of Windows, or other directory servers that use the LDAP protocol. If you are intending to use LDAP with something other than Active Directory, please contact Sysdig Support. The LDAP feature is only present in Sysdig software platform installs (not the SaaS version). LDAP support cannot be disabled once enabled. Only one LDAP config can exist per deployment (i.e. the platform can only query one directory server endpoint). Because the Sysdig software platform is based on the same technology as the SaaS-based Sysdig service, it theoretically supports the configuration of multiple “customers” using the same install. However, the multi-customer option is not supported when the LDAP feature is enabled. When LDAP support is enabled, adding users via email \"invites\" is not possible. LDAP authentication for directory usernames that begin or end with a space character (e.g. \" jdoe\" or \"jdoe \" ) are not supported. Configuration entries that contain special characters (for instance, a managerPassword that contains a backslash character) are supported, but note that you will need to perform proper JSON escaping. If you attempt to post invalid JSON, the helper scripts will return an error message, at which point you can use tools such as JSONLint to narrow down the source of the problem and\/or JSON String Escape to learn how to properly escape your text.

Introduction LDAP support in the Sysdig platform allows authentication to an on-premises install of Sysdig software using credentials in a customer’s own directory server. This document describes how to configure the feature as well as its limitations. Summary of Functionality Independent of the LDAP feature, the Sysdig platform ordinarily maintains its own user database to hold not only a username and password hash but also settings for Admin privileges, Team membership, and a user’s configured Dashboards and Alerts. The LDAP feature provides a means to allow the Sysdig platform to query the customer’s own directory server to validate username\/password and (optionally) confirm that the user is a member of one or more groups. Upon successful authentication, a corresponding user record in the Sysdig platform's user database is automatically created. When the LDAP feature is in use, the user’s password is not stored in the Sysdig platform user database. Configuration The LDAP feature is configured through the Replicated on-premise install option . It is disabled by default and, once LDAP is enabled, it cannot be disabled . To enable LDAP, first click the checkbox at the bottom of the Settings tab to expand the Advanced Settings : Then click the checkbox at the bottom of the newly-opened section to Enable LDAP : When expanded, the following options are revealed: Configure the settings as follows: Setting Required Description Server endpoint yes URL of the directory server for the Sysdig platform to query. An example for LDAP over SSL\/TLS: ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:636 For cleartext LDAP: ldap:\/\/176.16.0.1 CA certificate in PEM format for SSL\/TLS Click to upload a file containing the Certificate Authority (CA) PEM-format certificate that the Sysdig platform will use to validate its SSL\/TLS connection to the server. If you have a host with OpenSSL tools installed that can reach the directory server, you can obtain the certificate by running: # openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <server-ip>:636 DN manager yes The distinguished name of a user that the Sysdig platform can authenticate as via LDAP in order to perform further queries about the users attempting to login to Sysdig applications. Example: CN=servicer_acccount,OU=Service accounts,DC=demo,DC=com This setting is required, as the Sysdig platform does not support connection to servers via anonymous bind. Manager password yes The password for the DN manager. Root DN yes The distinguished name for the point in the LDAP tree below which all search queries will begin. Example: DC=demo,DC=com User search base no A relative distinguished name (from the Root DN) below which queries about users should be performed. If not specified, the search will be performed across everything below the Root DN. Example: CN=Users User search filter yes An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use in constructing the query to identify the user record. The marker token {0} represents where the Sysdig platform will place the username when it constructs its LDAP queries. An example that targets the attribute sAMAccountName in Active Directory: (&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0})) Group search base no A relative distinguished name (from the Root DN ) below which queries about groups should be performed. Example: OU=Groups Group search filter no An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform may use in constructing the query to identify a group to which the user must belong. An example that only permits users that are in the superusers group in Active Directory: (&(cn=superusers)(objectclass=group)) To permit users that are in the superusers group OR the devops group: (&(|(cn=devops)(cn=superusers))(objectclass=group)) However, AND logic to require membership in all of several groups is not currently supported If this setting is left blank, group membership is not required, and hence any user that successfully authenticates via username\/password will be permitted to login to your Sysdig application(s). Group membership IP filter no An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use to determine group membership. If no setting is specified, a default filter of (| (member={0}) (uniqueMember={0}) (memberUid={1})) is applied, which should work for most environments. In addition to the LDAP-specific sections of the Settings page, note that the Default user settings near the top of the page are also still required. This represents the only local user that will still login using an email address, bypassing LDAP, also known as the \"super\" Admin . This user is required and cannot be deleted. This login provides a way to access your Sysdig application(s) when LDAP connectivity is severed. This user is also the first Admin user in the install and therefore essential for assigning Admin rights to other users once they’ve authenticated via LDAP and their user records have been added in the Sysdig platform user database. Once other LDAP-authenticated users have been promoted to Admins, those Admins can promote other LDAP-authenticated users to Admin, and so on. Other local, non-LDAP users that were created before LDAP was enabled can still authenticate via LDAP as long as the username portion of their email address in the Sysdig platform user database matches their LDAP username. For example, consider a user johndoe@example.com who had been a user in the environment before LDAP was enabled. Once LDAP is enabled, if a user johndoe exists in the directory server and is able to authenticate successfully via LDAP, they will be permitted to log in to your Sysdig application(s) as the pre-existing johndoe@example.com user. Any user-specific configuration (Alerts, Dashboards, etc.) that were attached to johndoe@example.com will still be visible to this user. Limitations and Caveats LDAP support has been tested with Active Directory in Windows Server 2012 R2. It may work with AD versions that ship with other versions of Windows, or other directory servers that use the LDAP protocol. The LDAP feature as it exists in version version 858 and earlier of the Sysdig platform will always chase referrals found in LDAP query responses. If your directory is partitioned, ensure all necessary routing and\/or firewall settings are present to permit the Sysdig platform backend to contact all directory servers that may be referral destinations. The LDAP feature is only present in on-premise installs (not the SaaS versions of Sysdig Monitor\/Sysdig Secure). LDAP support cannot be disabled once enabled. Only one LDAP config can exist per deployment (i.e. can only query one directory server endpoint). Because the on-premise Sysdig platform is based on the same technology as the SaaS-based applications, it theoretically supports the configuration of multiple “customers” using the same install. However, the multi-customer option is not supported when the LDAP feature is enabled. When LDAP support is enabled, other means of adding\/validating users (e.g. sending “invites” to users, or e-mail verification) are not possible. The LDAP feature does not attempt any ongoing “sync” back from the Sysdig platform user database to the directory server. Note how this impacts the following: If a user is deleted from the directory server, their user record will remain in the Sysdig platform user database until a Sysdig Admin deletes it. Of course, that user will not be able to login since they will no longer be able to authenticate successfully via LDAP. If a Sysdig Admin deletes a user from the Sysdig platform user database, but the user can still authenticate successfully via LDAP, their Sysdig platform user record will be recreated if they login again via LDAP. If a person’s username should change in the directory server (e.g. the value for sAMAccountName in our example config table above), the next time they login, a new user record will be created for them in the Sysdig platform user database. In addition to user settings such as Admin rights, any Alerts or Dashboards attached to the prior username will not be visible.

If the Docker-container-based Sysdig agent is installed, the JRE is installed alongside the agent binaries and no further dependencies exist. However, if you are installing the service-based agent (non-container) and you do not see the JVM\/JMX metrics reporting, your host may not have the JRE installed or it may not be installed in the expected location: usr\/bin\/java Resource Limits The resource requirements of the agent are subjective to the size of and load on your host.

"body" : "In addition to the information on Host Requirements for Agent Installation , this page describes host requirements and kernel headers. Additional Requirements Access key The installation of the Sysdig agent requires an access key . This key and the agent installation instructions are presented to you after activating your account and using a web-based wizard upon initial login. The same information can also be found in the Settings > Agent Installation menu of the web interface after logging in. See Agent Installation: Overview and Key for details. Network connection A small Sysdig agent (containerized or native) is installed into each host being monitored and will need to be able to connect to the Sysdig Monitor backend servers to report host metrics. The agent must be able to reach the address ' collector.sysdigcloud.com ' (via multiple IPs) over port tcp\/6443 default. In earlier versions, the Sysdig Agent connected to port 6666. This behavior has been deprecated, as the Sysdig agent now connects to port 6443. The agent doesn't use HTTP protocol, thus does not support HTTP proxies. It is possible to use transparent TCP proxy: if a TCP proxy is in use, it must be transparent. Tags Tagging your hosts is highly recommended. Tags allow you to sort nodes of your infrastructure into custom groups in Sysdig Monitor. Replace the [TAGS] parameter in configuration file with a comma-separated list in the form of TAG_NAME:TAG_VALUE . For example: role:webserver , location:europe . See Understanding the Agent Config Files . TracePoints Support All supported distribution released kernels have this support but if creating a custom kernel, it must support the following options: CONFIG_TRACEPOINTS CONFIG_HAVE_SYSCALL_TRACEPOINTS About Kernel Headers and the Kernel Module The Sysdig agent requires a kernel module in order to install successfully on a host. This can be obtained in three ways: Agent compiles the module using kernel headers. If the hosts in your environment already have kernel header files pre-installed, no special action is needed. Or you can install the kernel headers manually; see below. Agent auto-downloads precompiled modules from Sysdig's AWS storage location. If the headers are not already installed but the agent is able to auto-download, no special action is needed. If there is no internet connectivity, you can use method 3 (download from an internal URL). Agent downloads precompiled modules from an internal URL. Use the environment variable SYSDIG_PROBE_URL . See also Understanding the Agent Config Files . Contact Sysdig support for assistance. To Install Kernel Headers In some cases, the host(s) in your environment may use Unix versions that do not match the provided headers, and the agent may fail to install correctly. In those cases, you must install the kernal headers manually. Debian-Style For Debian-syle distributions, run the command: apt-get -y install linux-headers-$(uname -r) RHEL-Style For RHEL-style distributions, run the command: yum -y install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) RancherOS For RancherOS distributions, the kernel headers are available in the form of a system service and therefore are enabled using the ros service command: sudo ros service enable kernel-headers-system-docker \nsudo ros service up -d kernel-headers-system-docker NOTE: Some cloud hosting service providers supply pre-configured Linux instances with customized kernels. You may need to contact your provider's support desk for instructions on obtaining appropriate header files, or for installing the distribution's default kernel. To Correct Kernel Header Errors in AWS AMI During an agent installation in an Amazon machine image (AMI) you may encounter the following errors while the installer is trying to compile the Sysdig kernel module: Errors \"Unable to find kernel development files for the current kernel version \" or \"FATAL: Module sysdigcloud-probe not found\" This indicates your machine is running a kernel in an older AMI for which the kernel headers are no longer available in the configured repositories. The issue has to do with Amazon purging packages in the yum repository when new Amazon Linux machine images are released. The solution is either to update your kernel to a version for which header files are readily available (recommended), or perform a one-time installation of the kernel headers for your older AMI. Option 1: Upgrade Your Host's Kernel First install a new kernel and reboot your instance: sudo yum -y install kernel\nsudo reboot After rebooting, check to see if the host is reporting metrics to your Sysdig account. If not, you may need to issue three more commands to install the required header files: sudo yum -y install kernel-devel-$(uname -r)\nsudo \/usr\/lib\/dkms\/dkms_autoinstaller start\nsudo service dragent restart Option 2: Install Older Kernel Headers Although it is recommended to upgrade to the latest kernel for security and performance reasons, you can alternatively install the older headers for your AMI. Find the the AMI version string and install the appropriate headers with the commands: releasever=$(cat \/etc\/os-release | grep 'VERSION_ID' | grep -Eo \"[0-9]{4}\\.[0-9]{2}\")\nsudo yum -y --releasever=${releasever} install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) Issue the remaining commands to allow the Sydig Agent to start successfully: sudo \/usr\/lib\/dkms\/dkms_autoinstaller start\nsudo service dragent restart Reference: Find Your AWS Instance Image Version The file \/etc\/image-id shows information about the original machine image with which your instance was set up: [ec2-user ~]$ cat \/etc\/image-id\nimage_name=\"amzn-ami-hvm\"\nimage_version=\"2017.03\"\nimage_arch=\"x86_64\"image_file=\"amzn-ami-hvm-2017.03.0.20170401-x86_64.ext4.gpt\"image_stamp=\"26a3-ed31\"\nimage_date=\"20170402053945\"\nrecipe_name=\"amzn ami\"\nrecipe_id=\"47cfa924-413c-d460-f4f2-2af7-feb6-9e37-7c9f1d2b\" This file will not change as you install updates from the yum repository.

Background Info You can review Agent Install: Kubernetes | GKE | OpenShift | IBM and the Host Requirements for Agent Installation for additional context, if desired. Installation Steps To deploy agents using Kubernetes daemonsets, you will download the following configuration files, edit them as required, and deploy them. sysdig-agent-clusterrole.yaml sysdig-agent-daemonset-v2.yaml sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml HELM CHART OPTION Kubernetes also offers a package manager, Helm , which uses charts to simplify this process. If you are using Helm charts in your K8s environment, we recommend using them to deploy Sysdig agents, as described here . Deploy the Agents Download the sample files sysdig-agent-clusterrole.yaml, sysdig-agent-daemonset-v2.yaml, and sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml. Create a namespace to use for the Sysdig agent. You can use whatever naming you prefer. In this document, we used sysdig-agent for both the namespace and the service account. The default service account name was automatically defined in sysdig-agent-daemonset-v2.yaml, at the line: serviceAccount: sysdig-agent. kubectl create ns sysdig-agent Create a secret key using the command: kubectl create secret generic sysdig-agent --from-literal=access-key=<your sysdig access key> -n sysdig-agent Create a cluster role and service account, and define the cluster role binding that grants the Sysdig agent rules in the cluster role, using the commands: kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-clusterrole.yaml -n sysdig-agent\nkubectl create serviceaccount sysdig-agent -n sysdig-agent\nkubectl create clusterrolebinding sysdig-agent --clusterrole=sysdig-agent --serviceaccount=sysdig-agent:sysdig-agent FOR ON-PREM INSTALLATIONS ONLY: Edit configmap.yaml to add the collector address and port , and SSL\/TLS information : collector: \n collector_port: \n ssl: #true or false\n ssl_verify_certificate: #true or false ssl_verify_certificate should be set to fa l se if a self-signed certificate or private, CA-signed cert is used. See information about SSL in on-premises here . (ALL INSTALLS): Apply the configmap.yaml file using the command: kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml -n sysdig-agent (ALL INSTALLS): Apply the daemonset-v2.yaml file using the command: kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-daemonset-v2.yaml -n sysdig-agent The agents will be deployed and you can check the Monitor UI to see some metrics. You can make further edits to the configmap as described below. Enable Kube State Metrics and Cluster Name These steps are optional but recommended. Edit sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml to uncomment the line: new_k8s: true This allows kube state metrics to be automatically detected, monitored, and displayed in Sysdig Monitor. For more information, see the Kube State Metrics entry in the Sysdig blog. Edit sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml to uncomment the line: k8s_cluster_name: and add your cluster name. Setting cluster name here allows you to view, scope, and segment metrics in the Sysdig Monitor UI by Kubernetes cluster. Note: Alternatively, if you assign a tag with \" cluster \" in the tag name, Sysdig Monitor will display that as the Kubernetes cluster name. Apply the configmap changes using the command: kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml -n sysdig-agent Proceed to verify the metrics in the Sysdig Monitor UI. There are two ways to update the agent configuration : Option 1: Edit the files locally and apply the changes with kubectl apply -f : kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml -n sysdig-agent Option 2: Use kubectl edit to edit files on the fly: kubectl edit configmap sysdig-agent -n sysdig-agent Running agents will automatically pick the new configuration after Kubernetes pushes the changes across all the nodes in the cluster. Verify Metrics in Sysdig Monitor UI Log in to Sysdig Monitor to verify that the agent deployed and the metrics are detected and collected appropriately. The steps below give one way to do the check. (See also Sysdig Monitor Documentation .) Access Sysdig Monitor: SaaS: https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com Log in with your Sysdig user name and password. Select the Explore tab to see if metrics are displayed. (Once you have enabled new_k8s:true ) To verify that kube state metrics and cluster name are working correctly: Select the Explore tab and create a grouping by kubernetes.cluster.name and kubernetes.pod.name .

"body" : " Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed environment for running Kubernetes in Google Cloud, in order to deploy containerized applications. As of Sysdig agent version 0.88 , Sysdig supports all flavors of GKE, including Ubuntu and GKE's default Container-Optimized OS ( COS ) . Note that the standard Sysdig agent cannot be installed on GKE COS because Sysdig relies on a kernel module that COS does not allow. To accommodate this limitation Sysdig has developed an alternate probe built on eBPF , a \"universal in-kernel virtual machine.\" The instructions below describe a standard GKE agent install and call out the special steps needed to install the eBPF probe if you are using COS. Preparation Open Port 6443 for Agent Ingress and Egress Because GKE uses stateful firewalls, you must actively open port 6443 for the Sysdig agent, for both inbound and outbound traffic. In earlier versions, the Sysdig Agent connected to port 6666. This behavior has been deprecated, as the Sysdig agent now connects to port 6443. GKE COS\/eBPF-Specific Requirements Linux kernel version >= 4.14. When performing the installation steps, you will add one additional parameter to install the eBPF probe. See Step 7, below. Background Info You can review Agent Install: Kubernetes | GKE | OpenShift | IBM and the Host Requirements for Agent Installation for additional context, if desired. Installation Steps To deploy agents using Kubernetes daemonsets, you will download the following configuration files, edit them as required, and deploy them. sysdig-agent-clusterrole.yaml sysdig-agent-daemonset-v2.yaml sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml HELM CHART OPTION Kubernetes also offers a package manager, Helm , which uses charts to simplify this process. If you are using Helm charts in your K8s environment, we recommend using them to deploy Sysdig agents, as described here . Deploy the Agents Download the sample files sysdig-agent-clusterrole.yaml , sysdig-agent-daemonset-v2.yaml, and sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml. Create a namespace to use for the Sysdig agent. You can use whatever name you want. In this document, we used sysdig-agent for both the namespace and the service account. kubectl create ns sysdig-agent Create a secret key using the command: kubectl create secret generic sysdig-agent --from-literal=access-key=<your sysdig access key> -n sysdig-agent If you are running Kubernetes 1.6 or higher, you must Grant your user the ability to create roles in Kubernetes by running the following command (see Google documentation for more): kubectl create clusterrolebinding your-user-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=your.google.cloud.email@example.org Create a service account for the Sysdig agent using the clusterrole.yaml file. The Sysdig agent must be granted read-only access to certain Kubernetes APIs, which the agent uses to populate metadata and provide component metrics. Sysdig provides a config file in GitHub. Deploying this file creates a cluster role and service account in Kubernetes, and defines cluster role binding that grants the Sysdig agent rules in the cluster role. Run the following commands (using whatever namespace you defined in Step 2): kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-clusterrole.yaml -n sysdig-agent\nkubectl create serviceaccount sysdig-agent -n sysdig-agent\nkubectl create clusterrolebinding sysdig-agent --clusterrole=sysdig-agent --serviceaccount=sysdig-agent:sysdig-agent FOR ON-PREM INSTALLATIONS ONLY: Edit configmap.yaml to add the collector address and port , and SSL\/TLS information : collector: \n collector_port: \n ssl: #true or false\n ssl_verify_certificate: #true or false ssl_verify_certificate should be set to fa l se if a self-signed certificate or private, CA-signed cert is used. See information about SSL in on-premises here . (ALL INSTALLS): Apply the configmap.yaml file using the command: kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml -n sysdig-agent FOR GKE COS ONLY: To enable the eBPF probe required for COS: Uncomment the following parameters in s ysdig-agent-daemonset-v2.yaml under the env section: env:\n - name: SYSDIG_BPF_PROBE\n value: \"\" (ALL INSTALLS): Apply the daemonset-v2.yaml file using the command: kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-daemonset-v2.yaml -n sysdig-agent The agents will be deployed and you can check the Monitor UI to see some metrics. You can make further edits to the configmap as described below. Enable Kube State Metrics and Cluster Name These steps are optional but recommended. Edit sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml to uncomment the line: new_k8s: true This allows kube state metrics to be automatically detected, monitored, and displayed in Sysdig Monitor. For more information, see the Kube State Metrics entry in the Sysdig blog. Edit sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml to uncomment the line: k8s_cluster_name: and add your cluster name. Setting cluster name here allows you to view, scope, and segment metrics in the Sysdig Monitor UI by Kubernetes cluster. Note: Alternatively, if you assign a tag with \" cluster \" in the tag name, Sysdig Monitor will display that as the Kubernetes cluster name. Apply the configmap changes using the command: kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml -n sysdig-agent Proceed to verify the metrics in the Sysdig Monitor UI. There are two ways to update the agent configuration : Option 1: Edit the files locally and apply the changes with kubectl apply -f : kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml -n sysdig-agent Option 2: Use kubectl edit to edit files on the fly: kubectl edit configmap sysdig-agent -n sysdig-agent Running agents will automatically pick the new configuration after Kubernetes pushes the changes across all the nodes in the cluster.

The agent can be installed two ways: As a standard Docker container As a non-containerized service The steps for each flavor differ slightly depending on whether you are using the SaaS or on-premises version of the Sysdig platform. If you are installing the Sysdig agent in an environment that has Kubernetes, use the Agent Install: Kubernetes | GKE | OpenShift | IBM instructions instead. Prerequisites See Host Requirements for Agent Installation . There you can check the requirements concerning: Supported Linux distributions Network connection Sysdig access key Cloud service providers (AWS, Google, and Microsoft Azure) and any steps you may need to configure to integrate the Sysdig agent. On kernel headers: The Sysdig agent requires kernel header files in order to install successfully on a host, and the agent is delivered with precompiled headers. If the hosts in your environment match the kernel versions included with the agent, no special action is needed. In some cases, the host(s) in your environment may use Unix versions that do not match the provided headers, and the agent may fail to install correctly. In those cases, you must install the kernel headers manually. See About Kernel Headers and the Kernel Module for details. Run any commands as root or with the sudo command. Have your Sysdig access key on hand. If you launch an agent install from www.sysdig.com, the welcome wizard will present an access key. Docker Container Agent Installation The Sysdig agent can be deployed as a Docker container. The commands below can also be copy\/pasted from the Welcome Wizard or the Agent Installation page in the Sysdig UI. In that case, your access key will already be included in the command automatically.

Alternate Option: Post a .json file If you are using a version of DC\/OS earlier than 1.8 then: Create a .json file for Marathon, in the following format. COLLECTOR, COLLECTOR_PORT, SECURE, and CHECK_CERT are used in environments with Sysdig's on-premises backend installed. See information on finding the collector address . They are not needed to install the agent for Sysdig SaaS accounts. $cat <<- EOF > \"sysdig.json\"\n{\n \"id\": \"sysdig-agent\",\n \"cpus\": 1.0,\n \"constraints\": [[\"hostname\", \"UNIQUE\"]],\n \"mem\": 850.0,\n \"instances\": YOUR-NUMBER-OF-INSTANCES-HERE,\n \"labels\" : {\"role\" : \"monitoring\", \"name\" : \"sdc-agent\" },\n \"container\": {\n \"type\": \"DOCKER\",\n \"docker\": {\n \"image\": \"sysdig\/agent\",\n \"forcePullImage\": true,\n \"network\": \"HOST\",\n \"privileged\": true,\n \"parameters\": [\n { \"key\": \"pid\", \"value\": \"host\" },\n { \"key\": \"env\", \"value\": \"ACCESS_KEY=YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-HERE\" },\n { \"key\": \"env\", \"value\": \"COLLECTOR=COLLECTOR-ADDRESS-HERE\" },\n { \"key\": \"env\", \"value\": \"COLLECTOR_PORT=COLLECTOR-PORT-HERE\" },\n { \"key\": \"env\", \"value\": \"CHECK_CERT=false\" },\n { \"key\": \"shm-size\", \"value\": \"350m\" }\n ]\n },\n \"volumes\": [\n { \n \"containerPath\": \"\/host\/var\/run\/docker.sock\",\n \"hostPath\": \"\/var\/run\/docker.sock\", \n \"mode\": \"RW\" \n },\n {\n \"containerPath\": \"\/host\/dev\",\n \"hostPath\": \"\/dev\",\n \"mode\": \"RW\"\n },\n {\n \"containerPath\": \"\/host\/proc\",\n \"hostPath\": \"\/proc\",\n \"mode\": \"RO\"\n },\n {\n \"containerPath\": \"\/host\/boot\",\n \"hostPath\": \"\/boot\",\n \"mode\": \"RO\"\n },\n {\n \"containerPath\": \"\/host\/lib\/modules\",\n \"hostPath\": \"\/lib\/modules\",\n \"mode\": \"RO\"\n },\n {\n \"containerPath\": \"\/host\/usr\",\n \"hostPath\": \"\/usr\",\n \"mode\": \"RO\"\n }\n ]\n }\n}\nEOF See Table 1: Environment Variables for the Sysdig name:value definitions. Complete the “ cpus ”, “ mem ” and “ labels ” (i.e. Marathon labels) entries to fit the capacity and requirements of the cluster environment. POST the created . json file to the leader Marathon API server. $curl -X POST http:\/\/$(hostname -i):8080\/v2\/apps -d @sysdig.json -H \"Content-type: application\/json\" Deploy the Sysdig Agent After deploying the agent to the Mesos Agent nodes, you will install agents on each of the Mesos Master nodes as well. If any cluster node has both Mesos Master and Mesos Agent roles, do not perform this installation step on that node. It already will have a Sysdig agent installed from the procedure in step A. Running duplicate Sysdig agents on a node will cause errors. Use the Agent Install: Non-Orchestrated (Docker Agent | Service Agent ) instructions to install the agent directly on each of your Mesos Master nodes. Use the Docker container instructions, or the non-containerized, service agent instructions, depending on your environment. When the Sysdig agent is successfully installed on the master nodes, it will automatically connect to the local Mesos and Marathon (if available) API servers via http:\/\/localhost:5050 and http:\/\/localhost:8080 respectively, to collect cluster configuration and current state metadata in addition to host metrics. Special Configuration Steps In certains situations, you may need to add additional configurations to the dragent.yaml file: If the Sysdig agent cannot be run directly on the Mesos API server If the API server is protected with a username\/password. Descriptions and examples are shown below. If the Sysdig Agent Cannot Run On the Mesos API Server Mesos allows multiple masters. If the API server can not be instrumented with a Sysdig agent, simply delegate ONE other node with an agent installed to remotely receive infrastructure information from the API server. NOTE: If you manually configure the agent to point to a master with a static configuration file entry, then automatic detection\/following of leader changes will no longer be enabled. Add the following Mesos parameter to the delegated agent's dragent.yaml file to allow it to connect to the remote API server and authenticate, either by: a. Directly editing dragent.yaml on the host, or b. Converting the YAML code to a single-line format and adding it as an ADDITIONAL_CONF argument in a Docker command. See Understanding the Agent Config Files for details. Specify the API server's connection method, address, and port. Also specify credentials if necessary. YAML example: mesos_state_uri: http:\/\/[acct:passwd@][hostname][:port]\nmarathon_uris:\n - http:\/\/[acct:passwd@][hostname][:port] Although `marathon_uris:` is an array, currently only a single \"root\" Marathon framework per cluster is supported. Multiple side-by-side Marathon frameworks should not be configured in order for our agent to function properly. Multiple side-by-side \"root\" Marathon frameworks on the same cluster are currently not supported. The only supported multiple-Marathon configuration is with one \"root\" Marathon and other Marathon frameworks as its apps. If the Mesos API server requires authentication If the agent is installed on the API server but the API server uses a different port or requires authentication, those parameters must be explicitly specified. Add the following Mesos parameters to the API server's dragent.yaml to make it connect to the API server and authenticate with any unique account and password, either by: a. Directly editing dragent.yaml on the host, or b. Converting the YAML code to a single-line format and adding it as an ADDITIONAL_CONF argument in a Docker command. See Understanding the Agent Config Files for details. Specify the API server's protocol, user credentials, and port: mesos_state_uri: http:\/\/[username:password@][hostname][:port]\nmarathon_uris:\n - http:\/\/[acct:passwd@][hostname][:port] *HTTPS protocol is also supported. Troubleshooting: Turning Off Metadata Reception In troubleshooting cases where auto-detection and reporting of your Mesos infrastructure needs to be temporarily turned off in a designated agent: Comment out the Mesos parameter entries in the agent's dragent.yaml file. Example parameters to disable: mesos_state_uri, marathon_uris If the agent is running on the API server (Master node) and auto-detecting a default configuration, you can add the line: mesos_autodetect: false either directly in the dragent.yaml file or as an ADDITIONAL_CONF parameter in a Docker command. Restart the agent.

This file should never be edited. dragent.yaml or configmap.yaml (Kubernetes) The configuration file where parameters can be added, either directly in YAML as name\/value pairs, or using environment variables such as ' ADDTIIONAL_CONF.\" Location: \" \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml .\" The \" dragent.yaml \" file can be accessed and edited in several ways, depending on how the agent was installed. This document describes how to modify dragent.yaml. One additional file, dragent.auto.yaml is also created and used in special circumstances. See Optional: Agent Auto-Config for more detail. Access and Edit the Config File There are various ways to add or edit parameters in dragent.yaml . Option 1: With dragent.yaml (for testing) It is possible to edit the container’s file directly on the host. Add parameters directly in YAML. Access dragent.yaml directly at\" \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml .\" Edit the file. Use proper YAML syntax . See the examples at the bottom of the page. Restart the agent for changes to take effect Native agent: service dragent restart Container agent: docker restart sysdig-agent Option 2: With configmap.yaml(Kubernetes) Configmap.yaml is the configuration file where parameters can be added, either directly in YAML as name\/value pairs, or using environment variables such as 'ADDTIIONAL_CONF.\" If you install agents as DaemonSets on a system running Kubernetes, you use configmap.yaml to connect with and manipulate the underlying dragent.yaml file. See also: Agent Install: Kubernetes | GKE | OpenShift | IBM Add parameters directly in YAML. Edit the files locally and apply with the changes with kubectl -f. Access the configmap.yaml . Edit the file as needed. Apply the changes: kubectl apply -f sysdig-agent-configmap.yaml Running agents will automatically pick the new configuration after Kubernetes pushes the changes across all the nodes in the cluster. Option 3: With Docker Run (Docker) Add -e ADDITIONAL_CONF=”<VARIABLES>” to a Docker run command, where <VARIABLES> contains all the customized parameters you want to include, in a single-line format. Convert YAML Parameters to Single-Line Format To insert ADDITIONAL_CONF parameters in a Docker run command or a daemonset file, you must convert the YAML code into a single-line format. You can do the conversion manually for short snippets. To convert longer portions of YAML, use e cho|sed commands. In earlier versions, the Sysdig Agent connected to port 6666. This behavior has been deprecated, as the Sysdig agent now connects to port 6443. The basic procedure: Write your configuration in YAML, as it would be entered directly in dragent.yaml . In a bash shell, use echo and sed to convert to a single line. sed script: \" | sed -e ':a' -e 'N' -e '$!ba' -e 's\/\\n\/\\\\n\/g' Insert the resulting line into a Docker run command or add it to the daemonset file as an ADDITIONAL_CONF . Example: simple Insert parameters to turn off StatsD collection and blacklist port 6443. YAML format statsd enabled: false blackisted_ports: - 6443 Single-line format (manual) Use spaces, hyphens, and \\n correctly when manually converting to a single line: ADDITIONAL_CONF=\"statsd:\\n disabled: false\\nblacklisted_ports:\\n - 6443\" Here the single line is incorporated into a full agent startup Docker command. docker run --name sysdig-agent --privileged --net host --pid host -e ACCESS_KEY=1234-your-key-here-1234 -e TAGS=dept:sales,local:NYC -e ADDITIONAL_CONF=\"statsd:\\n enabled: false\\nblacklisted_ports:\\n - 6443\" -v \/var\/run\/docker.sock:\/host\/var\/run\/docker.sock -v \/dev:\/host\/dev -v \/proc:\/host\/proc:ro -v \/boot:\/host\/boot:ro -v \/lib\/modules:\/host\/lib\/modules:ro -v \/usr:\/host\/usr:ro sysdig\/agent Example: complex Insert parameters to override the default configuration for a RabbitMQ app check.

You edit dragent.yaml using Helm syntax: Example $helm install --name sysdig-agent-1 --set \nsysdig.settings.tags='linux:ubuntu,dept:dev,local:nyc' --set \nsysdig.settings.k8s_cluster_name='my_cluster' stable\/sysdig Will be transformed into data:\n dragent.yaml: |\n tags: linux:ubuntu,dept:dev,local:nyc\n k8s_cluster_name: my_cluster Access and Edit the Config File Option 1: With dragent.yaml (for testing) Option 2: With configmap.yaml (Kubernetes) Option 3: With Docker Run (Docker) Convert YAML Parameters to Single-Line Format Example: simple Example: complex Option 4: With HELM Format Example " },

An entry in a section in dragent.yaml overrides the entire section in the default configuration. For example, the Pulling entry below will permit only kubernetes pod Pulling events to be collected and all other kubernetes pod events settings in dragent.default.yaml will be ignored. However, other kubernetes sections - node and replicationController - remain intact and will be used as specified in dragent.default.yaml. Example 1: Collect Only Certain Events Collect only 'Pulling' events from Kubernetes for pods: events:\n kubernetes:\n pod:\n - Pulling Example 2: Disable All Events in a Section To disable all events in a section, set the event section to none : events:\n kubernetes: none\n docker: none Example 3: Combine Methods These methods can be combined. For example, disable all kubernetes node and docker image events and limit docker container events to [attach, commit, copy] (components events in other sections will be collected as specified by default): events:\n kubernetes:\n node: none\n docker:\n image: none\n container:\n - attach\n - commit\n - copy Note: Format Sequences as List or Single Line In addition to bulleted lists, sequences can also be specified in a bracketed single line, eg.: events:\n kubernetes:\n pod: [Pulling, Pulled, Failed]\n So, the following two settings are equivalent, permitting only Pulling, Pulled, Failed events for pods to be emitted: events:\n kubernetes:\n pod: [Pulling, Pulled, Failed]\n \nevents:\n kubernetes:\n pod:\n - Pulling\n - Pulled\n - Failed Change Event Collection by Severity with log Parameter Events are limited globally at the agent level based on severity, using the log settings in dragent.yaml . The default setting for the events severity filter is information (only warning and higher severity events are transmitted). Valid severity levels are: none, emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, information, debug . Example 1: Block Low-Severity Messages Block all low-severity messages ( notice, information, debug ): log:\n event_priority: warning Example 2: Block All Event Collection Block all event collection: log:\n event_priority: none For other uses of the log settings see Optional: Change the Agent Log Level .

It is possible to filter custom metrics in the following ways: Ability to include\/exclude custom metrics using configurable patterns, Ability to log which custom metrics are exceeding limits After you identify those key custom metrics that must be received, use the new 'include' and 'exclude' filtering parameters to make sure you receive them before the metrics limit is hit. Filter Metrics Example Here is an example configuration entry that would be put into the agent config file: (\/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml) metrics_filter:\n - include: test.*\n - exclude: test.*\n - include: haproxy.backend.*\n - exclude: haproxy.*\n - exclude: redis.* Given the config entry above, this is the action for these metrics: test.* → send haproxy.backend.request → send haproxy.frontend.bytes → drop redis.keys → drop The semantic is: whenever the agent is reading metrics, they are filtered according to configured filters and the filtering rule order - the first rule that matches will be applied. Thus since the inclusion item for test.* was listed first it will be followed and that second 'exclude' rule for the same exact metric entry will be ignored. Logging Accepted\/Dropped Metrics Logging is disabled by default. You can enable logging to see which metrics are accepted or dropped by adding the following configuration entry into the dragent.yaml config file: metrics_excess_log: true When logging of excess metrics is enabled, logging occurs at INFO-level, every 30 seconds and lasts for 10 seconds. The entries that can be seen in \/opt\/draios\/logs\/draios.log will be formatted like this: +\/-[type] [metric included\/excluded]: metric.name (filter: +\/-[metric.filter]) The first '+' or '-', followed by 'type' provides an easy way to quickly scan the list of metrics and spot which are included or excluded ('+' means \"included\", '-' means \"excluded\"). The second entry specifies metric type (\"statsd\", \"app_check\", \"service_check\", or \"jmx\"). A third entry spells out whether \"included\" or \"excluded\", followed by the metric name. Finally, inside the last entry (in parentheses), there is information about filter applied and its effect ('+' or '-', meaning \"include\" or \"exclude\"). With this example filter rule set: metrics_filter:\n - include: mongo.statsd.net*\n - exclude: mongo.statsd.* We might see the following INFO-level log entries (timestamps stripped): -[statsd] metric excluded: mongo.statsd.vsize (filter: -[mongo.statsd.*])\n+[statsd] metric included: mongo.statsd.netIn (filter: +[mongo.statsd.net*]) " },

However, as of agent version 0.86 , it is possible to exclude designated containers from metrics collection. This can help reduce agent and backend load by not monitoring unnecessary containers, or-- if encountering backend limits for containers-- you can filter to ensure that the important containers are always reported on. This feature affects the monitoring of all the processes\/metrics within a container, including Prometheus, StatsD, JMX, app-checks, and built-in metrics. Overview If necessary, review Understanding the Agent Config Files . The examples on this page show how to enable\/disable container filtering in the dragent.yaml file. Convert the examples to Docker or Helm commands, if applicable for your situation. By default, the filtering feature is turned off. It can be enabled by adding the following line to the agent configuration: use_container_filter: true When enabled, the agent will follow include\/exclude filtering rules based on: container image container name container label Kubernetes annotation or label The default behavior in default.dragent.yaml excludes based on a container label ( com.sysdig.report ) and\/or a Kubernetes pod annotation ( . sysdig.com\/report ). Container Condition Parameters and Rules Parameters The condition parameters are described in the following table: Pattern name Description Example container.image Matches if the process is running inside a container running the specified image - include: container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app container.name Matches if the process is running inside a container with the specified name - include: container.name: my-java-app container.label.* Matches if the process is running in a container that has a Label matching the given value - include: container.label.class: exporter kubernetes.<object>.annotation.* kubernetes.<object>.label.* Matches if the process is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with the Annotation\/Label matching the given value. - include: kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: true all Matches all. Use as last rule to determine default behavior. - include: all Rules Once enabled (when use_container_filter: true is set), the agent will follow filtering rules from the container_filter section. Each rule is an include or exclude rule which can contain one or more conditions. The first matching rule in the list will determine if the container is included or excluded. The conditions consist of a key name and a value. If the given key for a container matches the value, the rule will be matched. If a rule contains multiple conditions they all need to match for the rule to be considered a match. Default The dragent.default.yaml contains the following default configuration for container filters: use_container_filter: false\n\ncontainer_filter:\n - include:\n container.label.com.sysdig.report: true\n - exclude:\n container.label.com.sysdig.report: false\n - include:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.sysdig.com\/report: true\n - exclude:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.sysdig.com\/report: false\n - include:\n all Note that it excludes via a container.label and by a kubernetes.pod.annotation. Enable Container Filtering in the Agent Config File Option 1: Use the Default To enable container filtering using the default configuration in default.dragent.yaml (above), follow the steps below. Apply Labels and\/or Annotations to Designated Containers To set up, decide which containers should be excluded from automatic monitoring. Apply the container label .com.sysdig.report and\/or the Kubernetes pod annotation sysdig.com\/report to the designated containers. Edit the Agent Configuration Add the following line to dragent.yaml to turn on the default functionality: use_container_filter: true Option 2: Define Your Own Rules You can also edit dragent.yaml to apply your own container filtering rules. Designate Containers To set up, decide which containers should be excluded from automatic monitoring. Note the image, name, label, or Kubernetes pod information as appropriate, and build your rule set accordingly. Edit the Agent Configuration For example: use_container_filter: true\n\ncontainer_filter:\n - include:\n container.name: my-app\n - include:\n container.label.com.sysdig.report: true\n - exclude:\n kubernetes.namespace.name: kube-system\n container.image: \"gcr.io*\"\n - include:\n all The above example shows a container_filter with 3 include rules and 1 exclude rule. If the container name is \" my-app \" it will be included. Likewise if the container has a label with the key \" com.sysdig.report \" and with the value \" true \". If neither of those rules are true, and the container is part of a Kubernetes hierarchy within the \" kube-system \" namespace, and the container image starts with \" gcr.io \" it will be excluded. The last rule includes all, so any containers not matching an earlier rule will be monitored and metrics for them will be sent to the backend. Logging When the log level is set to DEBUG, the following messages may be found in the logs: message meaning container <id>, no filter configured container filtering is not enabled container <id>, include in report container is included container <id>, exclude in report container is excluded Not reporting thread <thread-id> in container <id> Process thread is excluded See also: Optional: Change the Agent Log Level .

Apply Labels and\/or Annotations to Designated Containers 2. Edit the Agent Configuration Option 2: Define Your Own Rules 1. Designate Containers 2. Edit the Agent Configuration Use Smart Container Reporting Enable Smart Container Reporting and sysdig_aggregated Logging Overview By default, a Sysdig agent will collect metrics from all containers it detects in an environment. When reporting to the Monitor interface, it uses default sorting behavior to prioritize what container information to display first. Understand Default Behavior Out of the box, it chooses the containers with the highest CPU Memory File IO Net IO and allocates approximately 1\/4 of the total limit to each stat type. Understand Simple Container Filtering As of agent version 0.86 , it is possible set a use_container_filter parameter in the agent config file, tag\/label specific containers, and set i nclude\/exclude rules to push those containers to the top of the reporting hierarchy. This is an effective sorting tool when: You can manually mark each container with an include or exclude tag, AND The number of includes is small (say, less than 100) In this case, the containers that explicitly match the include rules will take top priority. Understand Smart Container Reporting In some enterprises, the number of containers is too high to tag with simple filtering rules, and\/or the include_all group is too large to ensure that the most-desired containers are consistently reported. As of <agent version ??>, you can append another parameter to the agent config file, smart_container_reporting . This is an effective sorting tool when: The number of containers is large and you can't or won't mark each one with include\/exclude tags, AND There are certain containers you would like to always prioritize This helps ensure that even when there are thousands of containers in an environment, the most-desired containers are consistently reported. Container filtering and smart container reporting affect the monitoring of all the processes\/metrics within a container, including StatsD, JMX, app-checks, and built-in metrics. Prometheus metrics are attached to processes, rather than containers, and are therefore handled differently. The container limit is set in dragent.yaml under containers:limit: Understand Sysdig Aggregated Container The sydig_aggregated parameter is automatically activated when smart container reporting is enabled, to capture the most-desired metrics from the containers that were excluded by smart filtering and report them under a single entity. It appears like any other container in the Sysdig Monitor UI, with the name \" sysdig_aggregated. \" Sysdig_aggregated can report on a wide array of metrics; see **Sysdig_aggregated Container Metrics** . However, because this is not a regular container, certain limitations apply: container_id and container_image do not exist. The aggregated container cannot be segmented by certain metrics that are excluded, such as process. Some default dashboards associated with the aggregated container may have some empty graphs. Use Simple Container Filtering By default, the filtering feature is turned off. It can be enabled by adding the following line to the agent configuration: use_container_filter: true When enabled, the agent will follow include\/exclude filtering rules based on: container image container name container label Kubernetes annotation or label The default behavior in default.dragent.yaml excludes based on a container label ( com.sysdig.report ) and\/or a Kubernetes pod annotation ( . sysdig.com\/report ). Container Condition Parameters and Rules Parameters The condition parameters are described in the following table: Pattern name Description Example container.image Matches if the process is running inside a container running the specified image - include: container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app container.name Matches if the process is running inside a container with the specified name - include: container.name: my-java-app container.label.* Matches if the process is running in a container that has a Label matching the given value - include: container.label.class: exporter kubernetes.<object>.annotation.* kubernetes.<object>.label.* Matches if the process is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with the Annotation\/Label matching the given value. - include: kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: true all Matches all. Use as last rule to determine default behavior. - include: all Rules Once enabled (when use_container_filter: true is set), the agent will follow filtering rules from the container_filter section. Each rule is an include or exclude rule which can contain one or more conditions. The first matching rule in the list will determine if the container is included or excluded. The conditions consist of a key name and a value. If the given key for a container matches the value, the rule will be matched. If a rule contains multiple conditions they all need to match for the rule to be considered a match. Default Configuraton The dragent.default.yaml contains the following default configuration for container filters: use_container_filter: false\n\ncontainer_filter:\n - include:\n container.label.com.sysdig.report: true\n - exclude:\n container.label.com.sysdig.report: false\n - include:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.sysdig.com\/report: true\n - exclude:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.sysdig.com\/report: false\n - include:\n all Note that it excludes via a container.label and by a kubernetes.pod.annotation. The examples on this page show how to edit in the dragent.yaml file directly. Convert the examples to Docker or Helm commands, if applicable for your situation. Enable Container Filtering in the Agent Config File Option 1: Use the Default Configuration To enable container filtering using the default configuration in default.dragent.yaml (above), follow the steps below. 1. Apply Labels and\/or Annotations to Designated Containers To set up, decide which containers should be excluded from automatic monitoring. Apply the container label .com.sysdig.report and\/or the Kubernetes pod annotation sysdig.com\/report to the designated containers. 2. Edit the Agent Configuration Add the following line to dragent.yaml to turn on the default functionality: use_container_filter: true Option 2: Define Your Own Rules You can also edit dragent.yaml to apply your own container filtering rules. 1. Designate Containers To set up, decide which containers should be excluded from automatic monitoring. Note the image, name, label, or Kubernetes pod information as appropriate, and build your rule set accordingly. 2. Edit the Agent Configuration For example: use_container_filter: true\n\ncontainer_filter:\n - include:\n container.name: my-app\n - include:\n container.label.com.sysdig.report: true\n - exclude:\n kubernetes.namespace.name: kube-system\n container.image: \"gcr.io*\"\n - include:\n all The above example shows a container_filter with 3 include rules and 1 exclude rule. If the container name is \" my-app \" it will be included. Likewise, if the container has a label with the key \" com.sysdig.report \" and with the value \" true \". If neither of those rules is true, and the container is part of a Kubernetes hierarchy within the \" kube-system \" namespace and the container image starts with \" gcr.io \", it will be excluded. The last rule includes all, so any containers not matching an earlier rule will be monitored and metrics for them will be sent to the backend. Use Smart Container Reporting As of <agent version ??> you can add another parameter to the config file: smart_container_reporting = true This enables several new prioritization checks: container_filter (you would enable and set include\/exclude rules, as described above) container age high stats legacy patterns The sort is modified with the following rules in priority order: User-specified containers come before others Containers reported previously should be reported before those which have never been reported Containers with higher usage by each of the 4 default stats should come before those with lower usage Enable Smart Container Reporting and sysdig_aggregated Set up any simple container filtering rules you need, following either Option 1 or Option 2 , above. Edit the agent configuration: smart_container_reporting: true This turns on both smart_container_reporting and sysdig_aggregated . The changes will be visible in the Sysdig Monitor UI.

"body" : "Introduction If you want to maintain centralized control over the configuration of your Sysdig Monitor Agents, one of the following approaches is typically ideal: Via an orchestration system, such as using Kubernetes DaemonSets or Mesos\/Marathon . Using a configuration management system, such as Chef or Ansible . However, if these approaches are not viable for your environment, or to further augment your Agent configurations via central control, Sysdig Monitor provides an Auto-Config option for agents. The feature allows you to upload fragments of YAML configuration to Sysdig Monitor that will be automatically pushed and applied to some\/all of your Agents based on your requirements. Enabling Agent Auto-Config Independent of the Auto-Config feature, typical Agent configuration lives in \/opt\/draios\/etc and is derived from a combination of base config in the dragent.default.yaml file and any overrides that may be present in dragent.yaml . See also Understanding the Agent Config Files . Agent Auto-Config adds a middle layer of possible overrides in an additional file dragent.auto.yaml .When present, the the order of config application from highest precedence to lowest now becomes: dragent.yaml dragent.auto.yaml dragent.default.yaml While all Agents are by default prepared to receive and make use of Auto-Config data, the file dragent.auto.yaml will not be present on an Agent until you've pushed central Auto-Config data to be applied to that Agent. Auto-Config settings are performed via Sysdig Monitor's REST API . Simplified examples are available that use the Python client library to get or set current Auto-Config settings. Detailed examples using the REST API are shown below. The REST endpoint for Auto-Config is \/api\/agents\/config . Use the GET method to review the current configuration. The following example shows the initial empty settings that result in no dragent.auto.yaml files being present on your Agents. curl -X GET \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config\n \n \nOutput:\n{\n \"files\": []\n} Use the PUT method to centrally push YAML that will be distributed and applied to your Agents as dragent.auto.yaml files. The content parameter must contain syntactically-correct YAML. The filter option is used to specify if the config should be sent to one agent or all of them, such as in this example to globally enable Debug logging on all Agents: curl -X PUT \\\n --header \"Content-Type: application\/json\" \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config -d '\n{\n \"files\": [\n {\n \"filter\": \"*\",\n \"content\": \"log:\\n console_priority: debug\"\n }\n ]\n}' Alternatively, the filter can specify a hardware MAC address for a single Agent that should receive a certain YAML config. All MAC-specific configs should appear at the top of the JSON object and are not additive to any global Auto-Config specified with \"filter\": \"*\" at the bottom. For example, when the following config is applied, the one Agent that has the MySQL Application Check configured would not have Debug logging enabled, but all others would. curl -X PUT \\\n --header \"Content-Type: application\/json\" \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config -d '\n{\n \"files\": [\n {\n \"filter\": \"host.mac = \\\"08:00:27:de:5b:b9\\\"\",\n \"content\": \"app_checks:\\n - name: mysql\\n pattern:\\n comm: mysqld\\n conf:\\n server: 127.0.0.1\\n user: sysdig-cloud\\n pass: sysdig-cloud-password\"\n },\n {\n \"filter\": \"*\",\n \"content\": \"log:\\n console_priority: debug\"\n }\n ]\n}' To update the active central Auto-Config settings, simply PUT a complete replacement JSON object. All connected Agents will receive centrally-pushed Auto-Config updates that apply to them based on the filter settings. Any Agent whose Auto-Config is enabled\/disabled\/changed based on the centrally-pushed settings will immediately restart, putting the new configuration into effect. Any central Auto-Config settings that would result in a particular Agent's Auto-Config remaining the same will not trigger a restart. Disabling Agent Auto-Config To clear all Agent Auto-Configs, use the PUT method to upload the original blank config setting of '{ \"files\": [] }' . It is also possible to override active Auto-Config on an individual Agent. To do so, follow these steps for your Agent: Add the following config directly to the dragent.yaml file: auto_config: false . Delete the file \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.auto.yaml . Restart the Agent. For such an Agent to opt-in to Auto-Config again, remove auto_config: false from the dragent.yaml and restart the Agent. Restrictions To prevent the possibility of pushing Auto-Config that would damage an Agent's ability to connect, the following keys will not be accepted in the centrally-pushed YAML. auto_config customerid collector collector_port ssl ssl_verify_certificate ca_certificate compression Introduction Enabling Agent Auto-Config Disabling Agent Auto-Config Restrictions " },

"body" : "If agents are disconnecting, there could be problems with addresses that need to be resolved in the agent configuration files. See also Understanding the Agent Config Files . Check for Duplicate MAC addresses The Sysdig agent will use the eth0 MAC address to identify the different hosts within an infrastructure. In a virtualized environment, you should confirm each of your VM's eth0 MAC addresses are unique. If a unique address cannot be configured, you can supply an additional parameter in the Sysdig agent's dragent.yaml configuration file: machine_id_prefix: prefix The prefix text can be any string and will be prepended to the MAC address as reported in the Sysdig Monitor web interface's Explore tables. Example: (using ADDITIONAL_CONF rather than Kubernetes Configmap ) Here is an example Docker run command installing the parameter via the ADDITIONAL_CONF parameter docker run --name sysdig-agent --privileged --net host --pid host -e ACCESS_KEY=abc123-1234-abcd-4321-abc123def456 -e TAGS=tag1:value1 -e ADDITIONAL_CONF=\"machine_id_prefix: MyPrefix123-\" -v \/var\/run\/docker.sock:\/host\/var\/run\/docker.sock -v \/dev:\/host\/dev -v \/proc:\/host\/proc:ro -v \/boot:\/host\/boot:ro -v \/lib\/modules:\/host\/lib\/modules:ro -v \/usr:\/host\/usr:ro sysdig\/agent The resulting \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml config file would look like this: customerid:abc123-1234-abcd-4321-abc123def456\ntags: tag1:value1\nmachine_id_prefix: MyPrefix123- You will then see all of your hosts, provided that all the prefixes are unique. The prefix will be visible whenever the MAC address is displayed in any view. See also: Agent Configuration . Check for Conflicting MAC addresses in GKE environments In Google Container Engine (GKE) environments, MAC addresses could be repeated across multiple hosts. This would cause some hosts running Sysdig agents not to appear in your web interface. To address this, add a unique machine ID prefix to each config you use to deploy the agent to a given cluster (i.e. each sysdig-daemonset.yaml file). Note: This example uses the ( v1 ) ADDITIONAL_CONF , rather than ( v2 ) Configmap method. - name: ADDITIONAL_CONF value: \"machine_id_prefix: mycluster1-prefix-\" " },

"body" : "If agents were successfully installed, you could log in to the Sysdig Monitor UI, but no metrics are displayed in the Explore panel, first confirm that the agent license count has not been exceeded. Then check for any proxy, firewall, or host security policies preventing proper agent communication to the Sysdig Monitor backend infrastructure. Check License Count If network connectivity is good, the agent will connect to the backend but will be disconnected after a few seconds if the license count has been exceeded. To check whether you are over-subscribed, go to Settings > Subscription . See Subscription: Change Number of Licensed Agents for details. Check Network Policy Agent Connection Port Check your service provider VPC security groups to verify that network ACLs are set to allow the agent's outbound traffic over TCP port 6443 . In earlier versions, the Sysdig Agent connected to port 6666. This behavior has been deprecated, as the Sysdig agent now connects to port 6443. Outbound IP Addresses Due to the distributed nature of the Sysdig Monitor infrastructure, the agent must be open for outbound connections to collector.sysdigcloud.com on all outbound IP addresses. Check Amazon’s public IP ranges file to see all the potential IP addresses the Sysdig agent can use to communicate with the Sysdig backend databases. Transparent Proxies While completely transparent proxies should work, non-transparent proxies (HTTP Proxies) will prevent proper communication. You can troubleshoot basic connectivity from the Sysdig agent on your host to our backend with: ping collector.sysdigcloud.com\ntelnet collector.sysdigcloud.com 6443 It should reply ' connected '. (For on-premises installations, see Architecture & System Requirements for more information on proxies.) AWS Metadata Endpoint AWS metadata is used for gathering information about the instance itself, such as instance id, public IP address, etc. When running on an AWS instance, access to the following AWS metadata endpoint is also needed: 169.254.169.254 Check Local Host Policy The agent requires access to the following local system resources in order to gather metrics: Read\/Write access to \/dev\/sysdig devices. Read access to all the files under \/proc file system.

If the Docker-container-based Sysdig agent is installed, the JRE is installed alongside the agent binaries and no further dependencies exist. However, if you are installing the service-based agent (non-container) and you do not see the JVM\/JMX metrics reporting, your host may not have the JRE installed or it may not be installed in the expected location: usr\/bin\/java See also: Troubleshooting: Why Can't I See Java (JMX) Metrics? Resource Limits The resource requirements of the agent are subjective to the size of and load on your host. At a minimum, the agent requires 2% of total CPU and 512 MiB of memory.

"body" : "Teams can be thought of as service-based access control . Purpose of Teams Organizing users into teams enables enforcing data-access security policies while improving users' workflows. There are different team roles, each of which has read\/write access to different aspects of the app. This limits the exposure of data to those who actually need it, and also makes users more productive by focusing them on data that is relevant to them. The following are some potential use cases for Teams: \"Dev\" vs \"Prod\": Many organizations prefer to limit access to production data. Permits isolating physical infrastructure and the applications on top. Microservices: Scoping data for individual dev teams to see their own dashboards and field their own alerts. Permits team creation based on logical isolation using orchestration or config management metadata. Platform as a Service: Where Ops teams need to see the entire platform. Enabling certain people to see all data for all services as well as the underlying hardware. This is perfect for managed service providers who are managing a multi-tenant environment, or devops teams using a similar model within their own organization. Restricted environments: Limiting data access for security and compliance. Certain services, such as authentication and billing, may have a very specific set of individuals authorized to access them. Organizations that need to segment monitoring for efficiency: Wide-ranging use case from very large organizations forming teams to simplify access, to smaller orgs creating ephemeral troubleshooting teams, to teams formed to optimize QA and Support access to system data. Operations Teams and Default Teams Out of the box, the Sysdig Platform has one immutable team for each product. Depending on licensing, an organization may use one or both: Monitor Operations team Secure Operations team Key traits of the immutable Operations teams: The teams cannot be deleted Users in Operations teams have full visibility to all resources in that product Administrators must switch to the Operations team before changing configuration settings for any team Administrators create additional teams, and can designate any team to become the default team for that product. The number of teams allowed in an environment is determined by licensing . Users entered in the Sysdig Monitor UI are auto-assigned to the Monitor default team; users entered in the Sysdig Secure UI are auto-assigned to the Secure default team. Team-Based Roles and Privileges In Sysdig Monitor, users can be assigned roles that expand or limit their basic system privileges on a per-team basis. System Role Team Role Admin Member of every team, with full permissions regardless of team assignment. Can create\/delete\/configure all users. Can create\/delete\/configure all teams. Team Manager (Monitor Only) Advanced User Standard User (Monitor Only) View Only (Monitor Only) Non-Admin Can create\/edit\/delete dashboards, alerts, or other content + ability to add\/delete team members or change team member permissions. NOTE: Team Managers only have user administration rights within the specific team(s) for which they are designated Managers. Can create\/edit\/delete dashboards, alerts, or other content. An Advanced User with no access to the Explore page (e.g. for developers who are not interested in Monitoring information). Read access to the environment within team scope, but cannot create, edit, or delete dashboards, alerts, or other content. See How Team Membership Affects Users' Experience of the UI for more detail. How Team Membership Affects Users' Experience of the UI Team membership affects user experience of the Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure UIs in various ways. At the highest level, the dashboards, alerts, and data you see are limited by the settings of the team you are switched to. In more detail, team settings affect the: Default landing page: The UI entry point is set on a per-team basis. Explore tab and dashboards: These are set per-team, per-user, and can be shared with the team. On first login, all team members see the same Dashboards Assigned to Me view. If a user changes those dashboards, only that user will see the changes. Dashboards created while part of a team are only visible to the user when logged in to that team, and if shared, are only visible to other team members. Visible data: A team's scope settings limit the data visible to team members while they are switched to that team, even if a user belongs to other teams with different settings that reveal additional data. Alert and Event: These settings are team-wide . Any member of a team can change the team’s alert settings, and any additions or edits are visible to all members of the team. Captures: Can only be taken on hosts\/containers visible to team members, and members see only the list of captures initiated by other members who were switched to the current team. API Token: Note that the Sysdig Monitor API Token found under Settings > User Profile i s unique per-user, per-team . This is necessary to enable the generation of Custom Events via the API to target a specific team. Switching Teams in the UI Users can switch between all teams to which they've been assigned, and Administrators can switch between all teams that have been created. To do so: Click the Selector button in the lower-left corner of the navigation bar. The assigned teams for this user are listed under Switch Teams. Click another team name. A popup window gives an overview of the new team-based view of the environment. The UI changes according to the team settings. Onboarding Best Practices: Plan teams and roles strategically to isolate access to data, customize interfaces, and streamline workflows. In general, administrators should: Create teams , invite users , and set roles in a planned manner Start with some dashboards and alerts for given teams to get started with Note: When a user logs in to a team for first time, they will see a wizard introducing dashboards, alerts, etc. specific to that team. Restricting New User Rights by Default By default, new users (added manually or through a third-party authenticator) are assigned Advanced User rights. If a administrator wants to limit new users' rights further, there are several ways to do so. Between sending the invitation and the user's first log in, change the user's Role in the default Monitor team to Read User. Note that there could theoretically be a lag in which the user would briefly have had Edit status. Integrate users into Sysdig via the Admin API and define read-only permissions upon import. Create a default team, in either Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure, with very limited scope and visibility. Manually assign users to additional teams with broader permissions as needed. " },

For testing purposes, you can use a third-party site to create a temporary endpoint to see exactly what a Sysdig alert will send in any specific notification. Option: Configure Custom Headers or Data By default, alert notifications follow a standard format (see Description of POST Data , below). However, some integrations require additional headers and\/or data, which you can append to the alert format using a custom header or custom data entry. For example, Ansible uses token-based authentication, which requires an entry for the bearer token.

In AWS Create an IAM Policy for Sysdig Access You could use the existing IAMReadOnly policy instead, but creating a Sysdig-specific policy provides more granular access control, activity can be easily distinguished in CloudTrail and it is considered best practice.

"body" : "The number of agent licenses purchased has two different effects on how Sysdig is used. The agent count defines the maximum number of agents you can deploy. E.g if you purchase 100 licenses, you can install 100 agents, potentially divided between Reserved and On-Demand agents. In AWS, it also determines the number of AWS objects that can be viewed in the Sysdig Monitor Dashboards (unrelated to the number of agents actually installed). In other words, if you have 100 licenses purchased, you can only see 100 AWS objects per region, per service type. See AWS Services Licensing for details. To see how many licenses (and therefore object views) are permitted in your AWS environment, check the Settings >Subscription page. To get an accurate view of which hosts have agents installed, apply the Agent Summary dashboard, using the smallest time interval allowed (to avoid seeing historical data). Reserved vs On-Demand Agents Reserved agents are purchased and used on an ongoing monthly basis. On-demand agents can be licensed hourly, for short-term needs. For example, an organization might schedule scale testing for two days and license an extra 500 on-demand agents for that time frame. The distinction between reserved and on-demand agents is financial, not technical; when on-demand agents are used they perform exactly like reserved agents. Connect Agents to the Backend The Sysdig platform uses a concurrent licensing model in determining when to allow an installed agent to connect to the back-end servers and report on host metrics. This means you can install Sysdig agents onto any number of instances. However, only the licensed number of agents will be allowed to connect and send metrics for recording and reporting. Agents connect on a \"first-come, first-served\" basis and in the event of an over-subscription (more agents wanting to communicate than are licensed) they will attempt to reconnect on a periodic basis. Once an existing communicating instance goes down and disconnects, the next agent attempting to connect will be allowed in. To avoid having agents refused connection due to over-subscription, monitor the number of established and allowed connections. To see how many licenses are in use, see the Settings > Subscription page. Use this information to either purchase additional license capacity from the UI, or to shut down lower-priority agents via normal orchestration and system administration means. Technical Details Multiple Installs: An agent is essentially an \"install\" of the software. If your system changes external IP addresses, or if you shut down a VM image and bring it back up elsewhere, this will remain the same agent connection. However, identical installs that are simultaneously sending data (usually an accident) will be considered two connections. A MAC address is used to identify a host for licensing purposes. Time Lag for License Release: When shutting down a host for any reason, the agent's license will not be immediately released. This permits the agent to retain its licensing slot for short outages or a reboot. The time-out interval can take up to 20 minutes, and if the connection has not been re-established within the interval the license will be released for use by the next host waiting to connect.

SAML support in the Sysdig platform allows authentication via your choice of Identity Provider (IdP) . The Sysdig platform ordinarily maintains its own user database to hold a username and password hash. SAML instead allows for redirection to your organization's IdP to validate username\/password and other policies necessary to grant access to Sysdig application(s). Upon successful authentication via SAML, a corresponding user record in the Sysdig platform’s user database is automatically created, though the password that was sent to the IdP is never seen nor stored by the Sysdig platform. This section describes how to integrate and enable SAML with both Sysdig Monitor and Sysdig Secure. For specific IdP integration information, refer to: Okta (SAML) OneLogin (SAML) ADFS (SAML) See also Caveats Basic Enablement Workflow Step Options Notes 1. Know which IdP your company uses and will be configuring. Okta (SAML) OneLogin (SAML) ADFS (SAML) These are the IdPs for which Sysdig has performed detailed interoperability testing and confirmed how to integrate using their standard docs. If your IDP is not listed, it may still work with the Sysdig platform. Contact Sysdig Support for help. 2. Decide the login flow you want users to experience (choose from three options): Click SAML button and enter a company name From app.sysdigcloud.com or secure.sysdig.com > page to enter company name. Type\/bookmark a URL in browser Monitor: https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/saml\/ COMPANY_NAME Secure: https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com\/api\/saml\/ COMPANY_NAME ?product=SDS Log in from an IdP interface The individual IdP integration pages describe how to add Sysdig to the IdP interface. You will need your Sysdig customer number on hand. 3. Perform the configuration steps in your IdP interface and collect the resulting config attributes. Okta (SAML) OneLogin (SAML) ADFS (SAML) Collect metadata URL (or XML) and test it. If you intend to configure IDP-initiated login flow, have your Sysdig customer number on hand. It will be referenced in later configuration steps as CUSTOMER_ID_NUMBER . 4 a. Log in to Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure Settings (as admin) and enter the necessary configuration information in the UI. Enable SAML as your SSO. 4 b. Repeat process for the other Sysdig product, if you are using both Monitor and Secure. You will enter a separate redirect URL in your IdP for each product; otherwise the integration processes are the same. Administrator Steps Configure IdP Select the appropriate IdP from the list below, and follow the instructions: Okta (SAML) OneLogin (SAML) ADFS (SAML) Enable SAML in Settings To enable baseline SAML functionality: Enter SAML Connection Settings Log in to Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure as administrator and select Settings. Select Authentication . Select the SAML tab. Enter the relevant parameters (see table below) and click Save . Connection Setting Options Description Sample Entry Metadata URL The URL provided at the end of the IdP configuration steps. XML An option that can be used for an IdP that doesn't support extracting metadata XML via URL. Signed Assertion off\/on Should Sysdig check for assertions signed in responses (to assist in validating correct IdP). ON Email Parameter email Name of parameter in the SAML response for user email ID. Sysdig uses this to extract the user's email from the response. email Validate Signature off\/on Sysdig backend should verify that the response is signed. ON Verify Destination off\/on Flag to control whether Sysdig should check the \"destination\" field in the SAMLResponse. Recommend ON, as a security measure. May be OFF in special cases, such as a proxy in front of the Sysdig back end. ON Select SAML for SSO Select SAML from the Enabled Single Sign-On dropdown Click Save Authentication . Repeat entire enablement process for Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure, if you want to enable on both applications. User Experience As noted in the SAML (SaaS)#Basic Enablement Workflow above, you can offer users three ways to log in with a SAML configuration: They can begin at the Sysdig SaaS URL and click the SAML button. Monitor: app.sysdigcloud.com or Secure: secure.sysdig.com They will be prompted to enter a Company Name, so the Sysdig platform can redirect the browser to your IdP for authentication. You can provide an alternative URL to avoid the user having to enter a company name, in the format: Sysdig Monitor: https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/saml\/ COMPANY_NAME Sysdig Secure: https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com\/api\/saml\/ COMPANY_NAME ?product=SDS You can configure an IdP-initiated login flow when configuring your IdP. The users then select the Sysdig application from your IDP's app directory and do not browse directly to a Sysdig application URL at all. Users that complete their first successful SAML login to Sysdig Secure may receive the error message \"User doesn't have permission to login in Sysdig Secure\". This is because only members of the Secure Operations team are permitted access to Sysdig Secure, and newly-created logins are not in this team by default. Such a user should contact an Administrator for the Sysdig environment to be added to the Secure Operations team. Environments that wish to have all users access Secure by default could use this sample Python script to frequently \"sync\" the team memberships. See Developer Documentation for tips on using the sample Python scripts provided by Sysdig. See also User and Team Administration for information on creating users. Caveats SAML Assertion Encryption\/Decryption is not currently supported. SAML Single Logout is not supported. Therefore, users should take care to log out directly from Sysdig application(s).

Review the summary and click Next to complete the configuration of the Relying Party Trust The next step will involve adding Claim Rules, so you can leave the box checked to Open the Edit Claim Rules dialog and click the Close button to be brought immediately into the Claim Rules editor Next we'll use Claim Rules to ensure that login data is sent as needed to the Sysdig platform. A user's login to the Sysdig platform is based on an email address, and a default ADFS configuration would not send the email address as required. The following configuration ensures the correct field from Active Directory is delivered in the claim. If not already in the Claim Rules editor from the previous step, navigate to it by right-clicking on the Relying Party Trust that was just created and selecting Edit Claim Rules Click Add Rule . At the following screen, accept the default rule template to Send LDAP Attributes as Claims and click Next . Enter a name for the rule, select Active Directory as the Attribute store , then use the pull-down selectors to pick E-Mail Address as both the LDAP Attribute and Outgoing Claim Type , then similarly make pull-down selections for Given Name and Surname . Once these selections are made, click Finish . Now click Add Rule again, this time selecting the template for Transform an incoming claim Enter a name for the rule, then use the pull-downs to select an Incoming claim type of E-Mail Address , an Outgoing claim type of Name ID , and an Outgoing name ID format of Email , then click Finish .

It can be tested once Sysdig Support has completed their side of the configuration using the metadata URL you send in your Support request. For IdP-Initiated Login Flow (Optional) (Optional) The steps above represent a Service-Provider-Initiated SAML configuration. If you would prefer an IdP-initiated SAML configuration, this is also possible with ADFS, but requires the additional steps described below. The Sysdig platform requires a specific setting of RelayState in order to accept IdP-initiated login flows. On the ADFS versions tested, we've found this use of RelayState is disabled by default, and a Microsoft article describes the topic in detail. To enable it, as described in a Microsoft forum thread , on your ADFS host, edit %systemroot%\\ADFS\\Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config and add <useRelayStateForIdpInitiatedSignOn enabled=\"true\" \/> to the <microsoft.identityserver.web> section. Once the modification is saved, restart ADFS services for the change to take effect. You will need to retrieve your Sysdig customer number as described in the Find Your Customer Number article. You will then need to generate an IdP-initiated login URL. In addition to having the correct settings, it must be properly URL encoded. To ease this configuration, use this ADFS RelayState Generator tool. When launched, enter the values below, then hit the Generate URL button. For the IDP URL String , enter https:\/\/YOUR_ADFS_SERVER\/adfs\/ls\/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx For the Relying Party Identifier , enter one of the following values: If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com For the Relay State\/Target App , enter #\/&customer=CUSTOMER-ID-NUMBER , substituting the CUSTOMER-ID-NUMBER you retrieved in the previous step This Results URL will be used in the metadata URL that you paste in the Metadata entry in the SAML connection settings . Use the Results URL from the tool to test your IdP-initiated login. Note that per this Microsoft forum thread , it is apparently not possible to configure ADFS to use such a URL when your users select the application from the pull-down menu at https:\/\/YOUR_ADFS_SERVER\/adfs\/ls\/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx . However, you may embed the URL into a custom portal or bookmarks list. Now you can test login using an Active Directory user that has an Email address configured. Test Metadata (Optional) To ensure the metadata URL you copy at the end of the IDP configuration procedure is correct, you can test it by directly accessing it via your browser. When accessing the URL, your browser should immediately download an XML file that begins similarly to the example shown below. No entry of credentials or other security measures should be required to successfully download it. If this is not the case, revisit the IDP configuration steps. <?xml version= \"1.0\" ?> <EntityDescriptor xmlns= \"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata\" entityID= \" https:\/\/app.onelogin.com\/saml\/metadata\/680358\" > <IDPSSODescriptor xmlns:ds= \" http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/09\/xmldsig#\" protocolSupportEnumeration= \"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol\" >names:tc:SAML: 2.0 :metadata \" entityID=\" https:\/\/app.onelogin.com\/saml\/metadata\/ 680358 \"> ...

"body" : "This guide is specific to cloud-based (SaaS) Sysdig environments. If you are configuring an On-Premises Sysdig environment, refer to OpenID Connect (On-Prem) instead. OpenID support in the Sysdig platform allows authentication via your choice of Identity Provider (IdP) . This section describes how to integrate and enable OpenID Connect with both Sysdig Monitor and Sysdig Secure. For specific IdP integration information, refer to: Okta (OpenID) OneLogin (OpenID) Keycloak (OpenID) Overview Summary of OpenID Functionality in Sysdig The Sysdig platform ordinarily maintains its own user database to hold a username and password hash. OpenID instead allows for redirection to your organization's IdP to validate username\/password and other policies necessary to grant access to Sysdig application(s). Upon successful authentication via OpenID, a corresponding user record in the Sysdig platform’s user database is automatically created, though the password that was sent to the IdP is never seen nor stored by the Sysdig platform. Basic Enablement Workflow Step Options Notes 1. Know which IdP your company uses and will be configuring. Okta (OpenID) OneLogin (OpenID) Keycloak (OpenID) These are the OpenID Providers for which Sysdig has performed detailed interoperability testing and confirmed how to integrate using their standard docs. If your OpenID Provider is not listed (including ones that do not support OpenID Connect Discovery ), it may still work with the Sysdig platform. Contact Sysdig Support for help. 2. Decide the login flow you want users to experience: 3 options Click OpenID button and enter a company name From app.sysdigcloud.com or secure.sysdig.com > page to enter company name. Type\/bookmark a URL in browser Monitor: https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/oauth\/openid\/ CompanyName Secure: https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com\/api\/oauth\/openid\/ CompanyName ?product=SDS Log in from an IdP interface The individual IdP integration pages describe how to add Sysdig to the IdP interface. You will need your Sysdig customer number on hand. 3. Perform the configuration steps in your IdP interface and collect the resulting config attributes. Okta (OpenID) OneLogin (OpenID) Keycloak (OpenID) Collect metadata URL (or XML) and test it. If you intend to configure IDP-initiated login flow, Find Your Customer Number and have it on hand. It will be referenced in later configuration steps as CUSTOMER_ID_NUMBER . 4 a. Log in to Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure Settings (as super admin) and enter the necessary configuration information in the UI. Save and Enable OpenID as your SSO. 4 b. Repeat process for the other Sysdig product, if you are using both Monitor and Secure. You will enter a separate redirect URL in your IdP for each product; otherwise the integration processes are the same. Administrator Steps Configure IdP Select the appropriate IdP link below, and follow the instructions: Okta (OpenID) OneLogin (OpenID) Keycloak (OpenID) Enable OpenID in Settings To enable baseline OpenID functionality: Enter OpenID Basic Connection Settings Log in to Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure as administrator and select Settings. Select Authentication . Select the OpenID tab. Enter the relevant parameters (see table below) and click Save . Connection Setting Description Client ID ID provided by your IdP Client Secret Secret provided by your IdP Issuer URL URL provided by your IdP. Example: https:\/\/YOUR-ONELOGIN-DOMAIN.onelogin.com\/oidc Okta, OneLogin, and Keycloak support metadata auto-discovery, so these settings should be sufficient for those IdPs. Enter OpenID Additional Settings (if needed) In some cases, an OpenID IdP may not support metadata auto-discovery, and additional configuration settings must be entered manually. In this case: On the OpenID tab, toggle the Metadata Discovery button to OFF to display additional entries on the page. Enter the relevant parameters derived from your IdP (see table below) and click Save . Connection Setting Description Base Issuer Required. Often the same Issuer URL , but can be different for providers that have a separate general domain and user-specific domain (for example, general domain: https:\/\/openid-connect.onelogin.com\/oidc , user-specific domain: https:\/\/sysdig-phil-dev.onelogin.com\/oidc )f Authorization Endpoint Required. Authorization request endpoint Token Endpoint Required. Token exchange endpoint JSON Web Key Set Endpoint Required. Endpoint that contains key credentials for token signature verification Token Auth Method Authentication method. Supported values: client_secret_basic , client_secret_post . (case insensitive) Select OpenID for SSO Select OpenID from the Enabled Single Sign-On dropdown. Click Save Authentication . Repeat entire enablement process for Sysdig Monitor or Sysdig Secure, if you want to enable on both applications. User Experience As noted in the Basic Enablement Workflow above, you can offer users three ways to log in with a OpenID configuration: They can begin at the Sysdig SaaS URL and click the OpenID button. Monitor: app.sysdigcloud.com or Secure: secure.sysdig.com They will be prompted to enter a Company Name, so the Sysdig platform can redirect the browser to your IdP for authentication. = You can provide an alternative URL to avoid the user having to enter a company name, in the format: Monitor: https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/oauth\/openid\/ CompanyName Secure: https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com\/api\/oauth\/openid\/ CompanyName ?product=SDS You can configure an IdP-initiated login flow when configuring your IdP. The users then select the Sysdig application from your IDP's app directory and do not browse directly to a Sysdig application URL at all.

Contents Agent Start Command or Manifest File Sysdig Agent Configuration File and Logs Docker Commands Kubernetes Commands Kubernetes: Check for Delegated Agents Docker Swarm: Find the Docker Swarm Master Agent Start Command or Manifest File Many agent connection problems are due to transcription errors in the agent start command or manifest files. This is especially true with truncated access keys and when using the Additional_Conf parameter in a container agent installation. Always cut and paste and then modify the Sysdig example commands or manifest files. The docker start and native agent run commands are available in the Settings > Agent Installation tab of the user interface. (If you are not an Admin level user you will not see the installation tab, in this case please request the instructions from the admin.) Try running the agent from the command line using the ' docker start ' or curl command. Send in the command used and initial agent output. Tip: if using docker start , remove the ' -d' option so output will display on the console. Sysdig Agent Configuration File and Logs It's helpful to attach the config file and latest log to your support request if you see metrics not reporting or have agent connection issues. Since the agent logs critical startup information when initializing, restarting the agent and then collecting the logs is desirable. For a container agent you can use: docker restart sysdig-agent For a native Linux service agent use: service dragent restart. The Sysdig agent reads the user-settings configuration file \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml. It generates log entries in \/opt\/draios\/logs\/draios.log . The agent will rotate out the log file when it reaches 10MB in size keeping the 10 most recent log files archived with a date-stamp appended to the filename. Include the host name that the files came from. Debug log level available Docker Commands To copy the configuration file and most recent log file out of an agent running in a container use these Docker commands: docker cp sysdig-agent:\/opt\/draios\/logs\/draios.log .\/draios.log\ndocker cp sysdig-agent:\/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml .\/dragent.yaml Kubernetes Commands To get the dragent.yaml config information, run the command: kubectl -n NAMESPACE describe configmap sysdig-agent > configmap.out To get the log files, run the command: kubectl -n NAMESPACE cp sysdig-agent-AGENT_ID:\/opt\/draios\/logs\/. . The above command will grab ALL the log files (including the rollovers) and place them in the directory where the command was run. Kubernetes: Check for Delegated Agents With agents deployed in a Kubernetes environment, it can be useful to know which agents are \"delegated\" to poll the Kubernetes API server. To do this, you must generate agent log files (see above) and search for 'delegated'. Logs are stored in \/opt\/draios\/logs\/draios.log. For agent versions 0.77.0 or later: you will see log entries stating whether your agent is\/is not the delegated node and the exact address of the delegated node. Search for the string \"Delegated'. For agents before version 0.77.0: issue the command: kubectl get nodes By default, the top two addresses automatically became delegated polling agents. Alternatively, enabling debug mode in agent versions 0.64.0 and beyond will show the node list in any agent logs as well. Docker Swarm: Find the Docker Swarm Master When using a Sysdig agent inside a Docker Swarm, metadata (information about inventory, labels, ext..) is collected from the Docker Swarm masters. Effort should be made to collect the logs from the masters, and more specifically the \"leader\" when a problem with Docker Swarm inventory is suspected. To determine which Docker Swarm nodes are masters and leaders: Run the command: docker node ls Example: $ docker node ls\nID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER STATUS\n789sgbfdbtcdtn9npbnkuz worker1 Ready Active\n76avknaakzbvmwlnh5jr3g * manager1 Ready Active Leader Under the Manager Status column, you can note which node is the \" Leader \".

"body" : "The Sysdig Monitor Agent uses its visibility to all running processes (at both the host and container levels) to find eligible targets for scraping Prometheus metrics. By default, no scraping is attempted. Once the feature is enabled, the Agent assembles a list of eligible targets in two steps: A process is determined to be eligible for possible scraping if it positively matches against a series of Process Filter include\/exclude rules. The Agent will then attempt to scrape an eligible process at a \/metrics endpoint on all of its listening TCP ports, unless the additional configuration is present to restrict scraping to a subset of ports and\/or another endpoint name. The metrics ultimately appear in the Sysdig Monitor Explore interface in the Prometheus section. Within the set of eligible processes\/ports\/endpoints, the Agent uses an auto-discover approach to scrape only ports that are exporting Prometheus metrics, and will stop attempting to scrape or retry on ports based on how they respond to attempts to connect and scrape them. It is therefore strongly recommended that you create a configuration that restricts the process and ports for attempted scraping to the minimum expected range for your exporters. This minimizes the potential for unintended side-effects in both the Agent and your applications due to repeated failed connection attempts. " },

Such environments can quickly begin scraping the same metrics using the Sysdig Agent in a couple easy steps. Enable the Prometheus metrics feature in the Sysdig Agent. Assuming you are deploying using DaemonSets , the needed config can be added to the Agent's dragent.yaml by including the following in your DaemonSet YAML (placing it in the env section for the sysdig-agent container): - name: ADDITIONAL_CONF\n value: \"prometheus:\\n enabled: true\"\n\n Ensure the Kubernetes Pods that contain your Prometheus exporters have been deployed with the following Annotations to enable scraping (substituting the listening exporter-TCP-port) : spec:\n template:\n metadata:\n annotations:\n prometheus.io\/scrape: \"true\"\n prometheus.io\/port: \"exporter-TCP-port\" The configuration above assumes your exporters use the typical endpoint called \/metrics . If an exporter is using a different endpoint, this can also be specified by adding the following additional optional Annotation, substituting the exporter-endpoint-name : prometheus.io\/path: \"\/exporter-endpoint-name\" If you try this Kubernetes Deployment of a simple exporter , you will quickly see auto-discovered Prometheus metrics being displayed in Sysdig Monitor.

"body" : "The process_filter section specifies which of the processes known by an Agent may be eligible for scraping. Note that once you specify a process_filter in your dragent.yaml , this replaces the entire Prometheus process_filter section (i.e. all rules) shown in the dragent.default.yaml . The Process Filter is specified in a series of include and exclude rules that are evaluated top-to-bottom for each process known by an Agent. If a process matches an include rule, scraping will be attempted via a \/metrics endpoint on each listening TCP port for the process, unless a conf section also appears within the rule to further restrict how the process will be scraped (see the \"conf\" section below). Multiple patterns can be specified in a single rule, in which case all patterns must match for the rule to be a match (AND logic). Within a pattern value, simple \"glob\" wildcarding may be used, where * matches any number of characters (including none) and ? matches any single character. Note that due to YAML syntax, when using wildcards, be sure to enclose the value in quotes ( \"*\" ). The table below describes the supported patterns in Process Filter rules. To provide realistic examples, we'll use a simple sample Prometheus exporter (source code here ) which can be deployed as a container using the Docker command line below. To help illustrate some of the configuration options, this sample exporter presents Prometheus metrics on \/promtheus instead of the more common \/metrics endpoint, which will be shown in the example configurations further below. # docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \\\n --label class=\"exporter\" \\\n --name my-java-app \\\n luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n \n# ps auxww | grep app.jar\nroot 11502 95.9 9.2 3745724 753632 ?

Pattern name Description Example container.image Matches if the process is running inside a container running the specified image - include: container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app container.name Matches if the process is running inside a container with the specified name - include: container.name : my-java-app container.label.* Matches if the process is running in a container that has a Label matching the given value - include: container.label.class: exporter kubernetes.<object>.annotation.* kubernetes.<object>.label.* Matches if the process is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with the Annotation\/Label matching the given value. Note: This pattern does not apply to the Docker-only command-line shown above, but would instead apply if the exporter were installed as a Kubernetes Deployment using this example YAML . Note: See the section below on Integrate Prometheus Metrics into Sysdig Monitor UI#Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. - include: kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape : true process.name Matches the name of the running process - include: process.name : java process.cmdline Matches a command line argument - include: process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\" port Matches if the process is listening on one or more TCP ports. The pattern for a single rule can specify a single port as shown in this example, or a single range (e.g. 8079-8081 ), but does not support comma-separated lists of ports\/ranges. Note: This parameter is only used to confirm if a process is eligible for scraping based on the ports on which it is listening. For example, if a process is listening on one port for application traffic and has a second port open for exporting Prometheus metrics, it would be possible to specify the application port here (but not the exporting port), and the exporting port in the conf section (but not the application port), and the process would be matched as eligible and the exporting port would be scraped. - include: port: 8080 appcheck.match Matches if an Application Check with the specific name or pattern is scheduled to run for the process. - exclude: appcheck.match: \"*\" Instead of the include examples shown above that would have each matched our process, due to the previously-described ability to combine multiple patterns in a single rule, the following very strict configuration would also have matched: - include:\n container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n container.name: my-java-app\n container.label.class: exporter\n process.name: java\n process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\"\n port: 8080 " },

Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. Note: If running the exporter inside a container, this should specify the port number that the exporter process in the container is listening on, not the port that the container exposes to the host. port: 8080 - or - port: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.port}\" - or - port: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation. prometheus.io\/port }\" port_filter A set of include and exclude rules that define the ultimate set of listening TCP ports for an eligible process on which scraping may be attempted. Note that the syntax is different from the port pattern option from within the higher-level include rule in the process_filter . Here a given rule can include single ports, comma-separated lists of ports (enclosed in square brackets), or contiguous port ranges (without brackets). port_filter: - include: 8080 - exclude: [9092,9200,9300] - include: 9090-9100 path Either the static specification of an endpoint to be scraped, or a container\/Kubernetes Label name or Kubernetes Annotation specified in curly braces. If the process is running in a container that is marked with this Label or is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with this Annotation\/Label, scraping will be attempted via the endpoint specified as the value of the Label\/Annotation. If path is not specified, or specified but the Agent does not find the Label\/Annotation attached to the process, the common Prometheus exporter default of \/metrics will be used. Note: A Label\/Annotation to match against will not include the text shown in red . Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. path: \"\/prometheus\" - or - path: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.path}\" - or - path: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation. prometheus.io\/path }\" host A hostname or IP address. The default is localhost. host: 192.168.1.101\n- or -\nhost: subdomain.example.com\n- or -\nhost: localhost use_https When set to true , connectivity to the exporter will only be attempted through HTTPS instead of HTTP. It is false by default. (Available in Agent version 0.79.0 and newer) use_https: true ssl_verify When set to true , verification will be performed for the server certificates for an HTTPS connection. It is false by default. Verification was enabled by default before 0.79.0. (Available in Agent version 0.79.0 and newer) ssl_verify: true Authentication Integration As of agent version 0.89, Sysdig can collect Prometheus metrics from endpoints requiring authentication. Use the parameters below to enable this function. For username\/password authentication: username password For authentication using a token: auth_token_path For certificate authentication with a certificate key: auth_cert_path auth_key_path Token substitution is also supported for all the authorization parameters. For instance a username can be taken from a Kubernetes annotation by specifying username: \"{ kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/username }\" conf Authentication Example Below is an example of the dragent.yaml section showing all the Prometheus authentication configuration options, on OpenShift, Kubernetes, and etcd. In this example: The username\/password are taken from a default annotation used by OpenShift. The auth token path is commonly available in Kubernetes deployments. The certificate and key used here for etcd may normally not be as easily accessible to the agent. In this case they were extracted from the host namespace, constructed into Kubernetes secrets, and then mounted into the agent container. prometheus: \n enabled: true\n process_filter: \n - include: \n port: 1936\n conf: \n username: \"{kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/username}\"\n password: \"{kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/password}\"\n - include: \n process.name: kubelet\n conf: \n port: 10250\n use_https: true\n auth_token_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/kubernetes.io\/serviceaccount\/token\"\n - include: \n process.name: etcd\n conf: \n port: 2379\n use_https: true\n auth_cert_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/etcd\/client-cert\"\n auth_key_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/etcd\/client-key\" " },

Another Process Filter rule ensures that any processes configured to be scraped by the legacy Prometheus Application Check will not be scraped. See the section below on the Legacy Prometheus Application Check for details. Another Process Filter rule is tailored to use of container Labels. Processes marked with the container Label io.prometheus.scrape will become eligible for scraping, and if further marked with container Labels io.prometheus.port and\/or io.prometheus.path , scraping will be attempted only on this port and\/or endpoint. If the container is not marked with the specified path Label, scraping the \/metrics endpoint will be attempted. If the container is not marked with the specified port Label, any listening ports in the port_filter will be attempted for scraping (this port_filter in the default is set for the range of ports for common Prometheus exporters , with exclusions for ports in the range that are known to be used by other applications that are not exporters).

"body" : "Multiple Agents can share the same configuration. Therefore, determine which one of those Agents scrape the remote endpoints with the dragent.yaml file. This is applicable to both Create a separate configuration section for remote services in the Agent configuration file under the prometheus configuration. Include a configuration section for each remote endpoint, and add either a URL or host\/port (and an optional path) parameter to each section to identify the endpoint to scrape. The optional path identifies the resource at the endpoint. An empty path parameter defaults to the \"\/metrics\" endpoint for scraping. Optionally, add custom tags for each endpoint configuration for remote services. In the absence of tags, metric reporting might not work as expected when multiple endpoints are involved. Agents cannot distinguish similar metrics scraped from multiple endpoints unless those metrics are uniquely identified by tags.

In the following example, the endpoint will not be considered unless both the annotations match: kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/region_scraper: europe\nkubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/scraper: true That is, Kubernetes nodes belonging to only the Europe region are considered for scraping.

"body" : "Sysdig Agent requires necessary permissions on the remote host to scrape for metrics. The authentication methods for local scraping works for authenticating Agents on remote hosts as well, but the authorization parameters work only in the Agent context. Authentication based on certificate-key pair requires it to be constructed into Kubernetes secret and mounted to the agent. In token-based authentication, make sure the agent token has access rights on the remote endpoint to do the scraping. Use annotation to retrieve username\/password instead of passing them in plaintext. Any annotation enclosed in curly braces will be replaced by the value of the annotation. If the annotation doesn't exist the value will be an empty string. Token substitution is supported for all the authorization parameters. Because authorization works only in the Agent context, credentials cannot be automatically retrieved from the target pod. Therefore, use an annotation in the Agent pod to pass them. To do so, set the password into an annotation for the selected Kubernetes object. In the following example, an haproxy account is authenticated with the password supplied in the yourhost.com\/haproxy_password annotation on the Agent node. - haproxy:\n kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_scraper: true\n conf:\n host: \"mymasternode\"\n port: 1936\n path: \"\/metrics\"\n username: \"{kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_username}\"\n password: \"{kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_password}\"\n tags:\n service: router Preparing the Configuration File Preparing Container Environments Syntax of the Rules Rule Conditions Authenticating Sysdig Agent " },

"body" : "In infrastructures already containing a third party StatsD collection server, StatsD metrics can be collected \"out of band\". A passive collection technique is automatically performed by our agent by intercepting system calls - as is done for all the Sysdig Monitor metrics normally collected. This method does not require changing your current StatsD configuration and is an excellent way to 'test drive' the Sysdig Monitor application without having to perform any modifications other than agent installation. The passive mode of collection is especially suitable for containerized environments where simplicity and efficiency are essential. With the containerized version of the Sysdig Monitor agent running on the host, all other container applications can continue to transmit to any currently implemented collector. In the case where no collector exists, container applications can simply be configured to send StatsD metrics to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1) as demonstrated above - no actual StatsD server needs to be listening at that address. Effectively, each network transmission made from inside the application container, including statsd messages sent to a non existent destination, generates a system call. The Sysdig agent captures these system calls from its own container, where the statsd collector is listening. In practice, the Sysdig agent acts as a transparent proxy between the application and the StatsD collector, even if they are in different containers. The agent correlates which container a system call is coming from, and uses that information to transparently label the StatsD messages. The above graphic demonstrates the components of the Sysdig agent and where metrics are actively or passively collected. Regardless of the method of collection, the number of StatsD metrics the agent can transmit is limited by your payment plan. Note 1 : When using the passive technique, ICMP port unreachable events may be generated on the host network. Note 2: Some clients may use IPv6 addressing (::1) for the \"localhost\" address string. Metrics collection over IPv6 is not supported at this time. If your StatsD metrics are not visible in the Sysdig Monitor interface, please use \"127.0.0.1\" instead of \"localhost\" string to force IPv4. Another solution that may be required is adding the JVM option: java.net .preferIPv4Stack=true. Note 3 : When StatsD metrics are not continuously transmitted by your application (once per second as in the case of all agent created metrics), the charts will render a 'zero' or null value. Any alert conditions will only look at those Statsd values actually transmitted and ignore the nulls. For more detail on the benefits of Sysdig Monitor's implementation of StatsD, please see the article State of the Art: StatsD Deployment Strategies in Containerized Environments . " },

"body" : "As of Sysdig agent version 0.90.1, a new configuration option permits the agent to reliably receive StatsD metrics from containers, even while the agent is under load. The Sysdig agent automatically parses and records StatsD metrics. Historically, the agent parsed the system call stream from the kernel in order to read and record StatsD metrics from containers. For performance reasons, the agent may not be able to collect all StatsD metrics using this mechanism. (For example, if the StatsD client writes more than 2kB worth of StatsD metrics in a single system call, the agent will truncate the StatsD message, resulting in loss of StatsD metrics.) This change introduces a new configuration option: statsd:\nuse_forwarder: true When set to true , then rather than use the system call stream for container StatsD messages, the agent instead listens for UDP datagrams on the configured StatsD port on the localhost within the container's network namespace. This enables the agent to reliably receive StatsD metrics from containers, even while the agent is under load. This option introduces a behavior change in the agent, both in the destination address and in port settings. Without the option, the agent will read StatsD metrics that are destined to any remote address. With the option set, the agent will receive only metrics addressed to localhost. Without the option, the agent will read container StatsD messages only destined to port 8125. With the option set, the agent will use the configured StatsD port. " },

Use service restart agent or docker restart sysdig-agent . Metrics for the relevant application should appear in the Sysdig Monitor interface under the appropriate name.

Example 2: Increase Polling Interval The default interval for an application check to be run by the agent is set to every second. You can increase the interval per application check by adding the interval: parameter (under the -name section) and the number of seconds to wait before each run of the script. interval: must be put into each app check entry that should run less often; there is no global setting.

"body" : "Review how to Edit dragent.yaml to Integrate or Modify Application Checks . Metrics from Kafka via JMX polling are already configured in the agent's default-settings configuration file. Metrics for consumers, however, need to use app-checks to poll the Kafka and Zookeeper API. You need to provide consumer names and topics in dragent.yaml file. Default Configuration Since consumer names and topics are environment-specific, a default configuration is not present in dragent.default.yaml . Refer to the following examples for adding Kafka checks to dragent.yaml. Remember! Never edit dragent.default.yaml directly; always edit only dragent.yaml . Example 1: Basic Configuration A basic example with sample consumer and topic names: app_checks:\n - name: kafka\n check_module: kafka_consumer\n pattern:\n comm: java\n arg: kafka.Kafka\n conf:\n kafka_connect_str: \"127.0.0.1:9092\" # kafka address, usually localhost as we run the check on the same instance\n zk_connect_str: \"localhost:2181\" # zookeeper address, may be different than localhost\n zk_prefix: \/\n consumer_groups:\n sample-consumer-1: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-1: [0, ] # sample topic name and partitions\n sample-consumer-2: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-2: [0, 1, 2, 3] # sample topic name and partitions Example 2: Store Consumer Group Info (Kafka 9+) From Kafka 9 onwards, you can store consumer group config info inside Kafka itself for better performance. app_checks:\n - name: kafka\n check_module: kafka_consumer\n pattern: \n comm: java\n arg: kafka.Kafka\n conf: \n kafka_connect_str: \"localhost:9092\"\n zk_connect_str: \"localhost:2181\"\n zk_prefix: \/\n kafka_consumer_offsets: true\n consumer_groups: \n sample-consumer-1: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-1: [0, ] # sample topic name and partitions If kafka_consumer_offsets entry is set to true the app check will look for consumer offsets in Kafka. The appcheck will also look in Kafka if zk_connect_str is not set. Example 3: Aggregate Partitions at the Topic Level To enable aggregation of partitions at the topic level, use kafka_consumer_topics with aggregate_partitions = true . In this case the app check will aggregate the lag & offset values at the partition level, reducing the number of metrics collected. Set aggregate_partitions = false to disable metrics aggregation at the partition level. In this case, the appcheck will show lag and offset values for each partition. app_checks:\n - name: kafka\n check_module: kafka_consumer\n pattern: \n comm: java\n arg: kafka.Kafka\n conf: \n kafka_connect_str: \"localhost:9092\"\n zk_connect_str: \"localhost:2181\"\n zk_prefix: \/\n kafka_consumer_offsets: true\n kafka_consumer_topics:\n aggregate_partitions: true\n consumer_groups:\n sample-consumer-1: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-1: [0, ] # sample topic name and partitions\n sample-consumer-2: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-2: [0, 1, 2, 3] # sample topic name and partitions Example 4: Custom Tags Optional tags can be applied to every emitted metric, service check, and\/or event. app_checks:\n - name: kafka\n check_module: kafka_consumer\n pattern: \n comm: java\n arg: kafka.Kafka\n conf: \n kafka_connect_str: \"localhost:9092\"\n zk_connect_str: \"localhost:2181\"\n zk_prefix: \/\n consumer_groups:\n sample-consumer-1: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-1: [0, ] # sample topic name and partitions\n tags: [\"key_first_tag:value_1\", \"key_second_tag:value_2\", \"key_third_tag:value_3\"]\n\n Example 5: SSL and Authentication If SSL and authentication are enabled on Kafka, use the following configuration. app_checks:\n - name: kafka\n check_module: kafka_consumer\n pattern:\n comm: java\n arg: kafka.Kafka\n conf:\n kafka_consumer_offsets: true\n kafka_connect_str: \"127.0.0.1:9093\"\n zk_connect_str: \"localhost:2181\"\n zk_prefix: \/\n consumer_groups:\n test-group:\n test: [0, ]\n test-4: [0, 1, 2, 3]\n security_protocol: SASL_SSL\n sasl_mechanism: PLAIN\n sasl_plain_username: <USERNAME>\n sasl_plain_password: <PASSWORD>\n ssl_check_hostname: true\n ssl_cafile: <SSL_CA_FILE_PATH>\n #ssl_context: <SSL_CONTEXT>\n #ssl_certfile: <CERT_FILE_PATH>\n #ssl_keyfile: <KEY_FILE_PATH>\n #ssl_password: <PASSWORD>\n #ssl_crlfile: <SSL_FILE_PATH> Configuration Keywords and Descriptions Keyword Description Default Value security_protocol (str) Protocol used to communicate with brokers. PLAINTEXT sasl_mechanism (str) String picking SASL mechanism when security_protocol is SASL_PLAINTEXT or SASL_SSL Currently only PLAIN is supported sasl_plain_username (str) Username for SASL PLAIN authentication. sasl_plain_password (str) Password for SASL PLAIN authentication. ssl_context (ssl.SSLContext) Pre-configured SSLContext for wrapping socket connections. If provided, all other ssl_* configurations will be ignored. none ssl_check_hostname (bool) Flag to configure whether SSL handshake should verify that the certificate matches the broker's hostname. true ssl_cafile (str) Optional filename of ca file to use in certificate veriication. none ssl_certfile (str) Optional filename of file in pem format containing the client certificate, as well as any CA certificates needed to establish the certificate’s authenticity. none ssl_keyfile (str) Optional filename containing the client private key. none ssl_password (str) Optional password to be used when loading the certificate chain. none ssl_crlfile (str) Optional filename containing the CRL to check for certificate expiration. By default, no CRL check is done. When providing a file, only the leaf certificate will be checked against this CRL. The CRL can only be checked with 2.7.9+. none " },

This setting defaults to GET, though many other HTTP methods are supported, including POST and PUT. data The data option is only available when using the POST method. Data should be included as key-value pairs and will be sent in the body of the request. content_match A string or Python regular expression. The HTTP check will search for this value in the response and will report as DOWN if the string or expression is not found. reverse_content_match When true, reverses the behavior of the content_match option, i.e. the HTTP check will report as DOWN if the string or expression in content_match IS found. (default is false) username & password If your service uses basic authentication, you can provide the username and password here. http_response_status_code A string or Python regular expression for an HTTP status code. This check will report DOWN for any status code that does not match. This defaults to 1xx, 2xx and 3xx HTTP status codes. For example: 401 or 4\\d\\d . include_content When set to true , the check will include the first 200 characters of the HTTP response body in notifications. The default value is false . collect_response_time By default, the check will collect the response time (in seconds) as the metric network.http.response_time . To disable, set this value to false . disable_ssl_validation This setting will skip SSL certificate validation and is enabled by default. If you require SSL certificate validation, set this to false . This option is only used when gathering the response time\/aliveness from the specified endpoint. Note this setting doesn’t apply to the check_certificate_expiration option. ignore_ssl_warning When SSL certificate validation is enabled (see setting above), this setting allows you to disable security warnings. ca_certs This setting allows you to override the default certificate path as specified in init_config check_certificate_expiration When check_certificate_expiration is enabled, the service check will check the expiration date of the SSL certificate. Note that this will cause the SSL certificate to be validated, regardless of the value of the disable_ssl_validation setting. days_warning When check_certificate_expiration is enabled, these settings will raise a warning alert when the SSL certificate is within the specified number of days from expiration. check_hostname When check_certificate_expiration is enabled, this setting will raise a warning if the hostname on the SSL certificate does not match the host of the given URL. headers This parameter allows you to send additional headers with the request. e.g. X-Auth-Token: <AUTH_TOKEN> skip_proxy If set, the check will bypass proxy settings and attempt to reach the check URL directly. This defaults to false . allow_redirects This setting allows the service check to follow HTTP redirects and defaults to true . tags A list of arbitrary tags that will be associated with the check.

If any of these entities are present but no transactions have occurred for them, the metrics are still reported with 0 values, though without tags. Therefore, when segmenting these metrics, the tags will show as unset in the Sysdig Monitor Explore view. However, all such entities are still counted against the maximum limits.

"body" : " Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard protocol for collecting and configuring information about devices in the networks. The network devices include physical devices like switches, routers, servers etc. SNMP has three primary versions ( SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3) and SNMPv2c is most widely used. SNMP allows device vendors to expose management data in the form of variables on managed systems organized in a management information base (MIB), which describe the system status and configuration. The devices can be queried as well as configured remotely using these variables. Certain MIBs are generic and supported by the majority of the device vendors. Additionally, each vendor can have their own private\/enterprise MIBs for vendor-specific information. SNMP MIB is a collection of objects uniquely identified by an Object Identifier (OID). OIDs are represented in the form of x.0, where x is the name of object in the MIB definition. For example, suppose one wanted to identify an instance of the variable sysDescr \n\nThe object class for sysDescr is: \n\niso org dod internet mgmt mib system sysDescr \n 1 3 6 1 2 1 1 1\n\nHence, the object type, x, would be 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1 " },

"body" : "In infrastructures already containing a third party StatsD collection server, StatsD metrics can be collected \"out of band\". A passive collection technique is automatically performed by our agent by intercepting system calls - as is done for all the Sysdig Monitor metrics normally collected. This method does not require changing your current StatsD configuration and is an excellent way to 'test drive' the Sysdig Monitor application without having to perform any modifications other than agent installation. The passive mode of collection is especially suitable for containerized environments where simplicity and efficiency are essential. With the containerized version of the Sysdig Monitor agent running on the host, all other container applications can continue to transmit to any currently implemented collector. In the case where no collector exists, container applications can simply be configured to send StatsD metrics to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1) as demonstrated above - no actual StatsD server needs to be listening at that address. Effectively, each network transmission made from inside the application container, including StatsD messages sent to a non-existent destination, generates a system call. The Sysdig agent captures these system calls from its own container, where the statsd collector is listening. In practice, the Sysdig agent acts as a transparent proxy between the application and the StatsD collector, even if they are in different containers. The agent correlates which container a system call is coming from, and uses that information to transparently label the StatsD messages. The above graphic demonstrates the components of the Sysdig agent and where metrics are actively or passively collected. Regardless of the method of collection, the number of StatsD metrics the agent can transmit is limited by your payment plan. Note 1 : When using the passive technique, ICMP port unreachable events may be generated on the host network. Note 2: Some clients may use IPv6 addressing (::1) for the \"localhost\" address string. Metrics collection over IPv6 is not supported at this time. If your StatsD metrics are not visible in the Sysdig Monitor interface, please use \"127.0.0.1\" instead of \"localhost\" string to force IPv4. Another solution that may be required is adding the JVM option: java.net .preferIPv4Stack=true. Note 3 : When StatsD metrics are not continuously transmitted by your application (once per second as in the case of all agent created metrics), the charts will render a 'zero' or null value. Any alert conditions will only look at those StatsD values actually transmitted and ignore the nulls. For more detail on the benefits of Sysdig Monitor's implementation of StatsD, please see the article State of the Art: StatsD Deployment Strategies in Containerized Environments . " },

"body" : " As of Sysdig agent version 0.90.1, a new configuration option permits the agent to reliably receive StatsD metrics from containers, even while the agent is under load. The Sysdig agent automatically parses and records StatsD metrics. Historically, the agent parsed the system call stream from the kernel in order to read and record StatsD metrics from containers. For performance reasons, the agent may not be able to collect all StatsD metrics using this mechanism. (For example, if the StatsD client writes more than 2kB worth of StatsD metrics in a single system call, the agent will truncate the StatsD message, resulting in loss of StatsD metrics.) This change introduces a new configuration option: statsd:\n use_forwarder: true When set to true , then rather than use the system call stream for container StatsD messages, the agent instead listens for UDP datagrams on the configured StatsD port on the localhost within the container's network namespace. This enables the agent to reliably receive StatsD metrics from containers, even while the agent is under load. This option introduces a behavior change in the agent, both in the destination address and in port settings. Without the option, the agent will read StatsD metrics that are destined to any remote address. With the option set, the agent will receive only metrics addressed to localhost. Without the option, the agent will read container StatsD messages only destined to port 8125. With the option set, the agent will use the configured StatsD port. " },

One way to handle this is by setting environment variables before running your Python scripts: export SDC_URL='https:\/\/<YOUR-API-SERVER-HOSTNAME-OR-IP>'\nexport SDC_SSL_VERIFY='false' Alternatively, you can specify the additional arguments in your Python scripts as you instantiate the SDC client: client = SdMonitorClient(api_token, sdc_url='https:\/\/<YOUR-API-SERVER-HOSTNAME-OR-IP>', ssl_verify=False) Instantiate the Library Classes The library exports two classes, SdMonitorClient and SdSecureClient which are used to connect to the Sysdig Monitor\/Secure back end and execute actions. (For backwards compatibility purposes, a third class SdcClient is exported which is an alias of SdMonitorClient .) They can be instantiated like this: from sdcclient import SdMonitorClient\n\napi_token =\"MY_API_TOKEN\"\n\n#\n# Instantiate the Sysdig Monitor client\n#\nclient = SdMonitorClient(api_token) Once instantiated, all the methods documented in the Python Script Library can be called on the object. Return Values Every method in the SdMonitorClient\/SdSecureClient classes returns a list with two entries . The first one is a boolean value indicating if the call was successful. The second entry depends on the result: If the call was successful, it's a dictionary reflecting the json returned by the underlying REST call If the call failed, it's a string describing the error For an example on how to parse this output, take a look at a simple example like get_data_simple.py Using Logs for Learning Purposes If your goal is to interact with the REST API directly, you can use the Python client library to understand the REST interactions by logging the actions it takes. This is useful because full documentation of the REST API has not yet been created; it also provides a complete example of known working operations. Use or modify an example, or write a new script against the Python sdcclient module. Log the HTTP requests made by the script. To log all the requests made by your script in significant detail, add to your script: import logging\nimport httplib\nhttplib.HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1\n\nlogging.basicConfig() # you need to initialize logging, otherwise you will not see anything from requests\nlogging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nrequests_log = logging.getLogger(\"requests.packages.urllib3\")\nrequests_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\nrequests_log.propagate = True Then run as normal. Next Steps Explore the script library and function list . Explore the sample Python scripts provided.

All your dashboards are automatically migrated to the new format and expected to work as before. The Python client library and Grafana data source are updated to work seamlessly with the new dashboard format. You can continue using the provided by the Python client library to store dashboards locally and restore from the archive file. However, restoring dashboards from the previous version of JSON object archives requires you to edit them to match the new schema. Because several changes are introduced in the V2 schema, you must migrate the existing JSON objects in V1 to V2, before restoring them to the list of dashboards. " },

For service or orchestrator constructs, the container CPU is aggregated based on container labels. Hosts The CPU usage for each host is obtained from \/proc, and measured as the sum of the CPU usage of all cores, normalized by dividing by the number of cores. The CPU usage for each host is the sum of cpu.user.percent, cpu.nice.percent, cpu.stolen.percent, and cpu.system.percent. The Linux command top can be used to review these values as well. Processes The CPU usage for each process is obtained from \/proc, and normalized by dividing by the number of cores. When cpu.used.percent is segmented by process at the host level, the sum of the CPU usage of each process may not always add up to the CPU usage of the host. The most common reasons for this are: There are short-lived processes that spike for less than two seconds. Granular data is retained for the highest CPU usage processes, rather than all processes.

The save script stores all current dashboards for the active account in a .zip archive, while the restore script adds all dashboards in the archive to the list of dashboards. Restoring dashboards will not override the user's existing dashboards. Instead, new dashboards will be added to the list. If this script is used in a strictly backup\/restore capacity, dashboards will need to be deleted manually from the account, either before or after the restore action is completed. The restore script does not have to target the same account as the save script. This allows dashboards to be saved from one user, and restored to multiple users. Save All Dashboards with download_dashboards.py a Python Script To save the dashboards: In a terminal, access the virtual environment set up in Download the Scripts. Run the script, replacing API_TOKEN with the API token for the relevant user, and SAVED_DASHBOARDS.ZIP with the desired name of the zip file: The user API token can be found in the User Profile tab of the UI Settings page. (venv) $ sudo python examples\/download_dashboards.py API_TOKEN SAVED_DASHBOARDS.ZIP Dashboard name: JVM, # Charts: 5 Finished writing dashboard data in zip format to SAVED_DASHBOARDS.ZIP Restore Dashboards with restore_dashboards.py a Python Script To restore dashboards from a .zip archive In a terminal, access the virtual environment set up in Download the Scripts.

The example program get_secure _ policy_events.py , with the --summarize argument, provides a summarized view of the policy events ordered by frequency. --summarize also removes any container information from the output strings, to allow for better aggregation of similar events. Sysdig also recommends using the python-sdc-client , and in particular get_secure_policy_events.py , to collect policy events for on-premises customers, as Sysdig does not have direct access to the UI for troubleshooting, and the program can be written to a file, and passed on as feedback.

Fixed issue with container \"incomplete\" reporting status Starting with version 0.90.0, the agent would report containers for which it had not yet fetched metadata as \"incomplete.\" This would then propagate to the Monitor UI. This restores the behavior where the agent leaves the unknown fields unset. Resolved REST server issue Fixed problem where an enabled port would respond to HTTP requests when not desired. Fixed issue with StatsD metrics collection Previous versions of the Sysdig agent, when configured to use the StatsD fowarder ( {{statsd.use_forwarder: true}} ) truncated messages that it received from containers to 2048 bytes, resulting in the potential for dropped and corrupted metrics.

Fix to make agent - backend connection more robust Fixed an issue that occurs when the agent is reconnecting to the collector and then gets restarted. Provide StatsD option to run statsite_forwarder in driver mode The Sysdig agent automatically parses and records StatsD metrics. Historically, the agent parsed the system call stream from the kernel in order to read and record StatsD metrics from containers. For performance reasons, the agent may not be able to collect all StatsD metrics using this mechanism. (For example, if the StatsD client writes more than 2kB worth of StatsD metrics in a single system call, the agent will truncate the StatsD message, resulting in loss of StatsD metrics.) This change introduces a new configuration option: statsd:\n use_forwarder: true When set, this option enables the agent reliably to receive StatsD metrics from containers, even while the agent is under load.

An issue occurred when additional processes used these POSIX queues, as the configured resource limits were set for the Sysdig agent’s use only, resulting in the resource limits being reached and at times surpassed. To resolve the issue, the Sysdig agent is now always run in its own IPC namespace, isolating it from interference from other processes using POSIX queues. In addition, the queue limits can be configured manually in the dragent.yaml file if necessary. The queue limits cannot be set to less than the minimum Sysdig would automatically set them to.

The menu displays an alphabetical list of Dashboards you own and those shared by your team. With the popover menu, you can add new Dashboards and search for existing ones. Click a Dashboard name to access the relevant Dashboard page where you can continue with the regular Dashboard settings. Customize Alert Notification Template Sysdig Monitor alerts now provide an option to customize the messages that are sent with alert notifications in email and other channels, such as Pagerduty and Webhook. Use the Alert Editor to input dynamic variables, such as hostname, or a hyperlink, and to add custom messages in plain text to the notifications for intended recipients. You can modify both the subject and the body of the alert notification with a hyperlink or a variable. For example, you can add an agent id or a link to a Dashboard to the message. This can help provide context for troubleshooting the errors that triggered the alert. For more information, see Customizing Alert Notification . Prometheus Remote Scraping Sysdig Monitor can now collect Prometheus metrics from remote endpoints with minimal configuration. Remote endpoints (remote hosts) refer to hosts where the Sysdig agent cannot be deployed, e.g., a Kubernetes master node on managed Kubernetes services such as GKE and EKS, where user workload cannot be deployed. To enable remote scraping on such hosts, simply identify an agent to perform the scraping and declare the endpoint configurations in the agent configuration file. The collected Prometheus metrics are reported under and associated with the agent that performed the scraping, rather than with a process. See Collecting Prometheus Metrics from Remote Hosts for details Enhancements to Kafka App Check Kafka integrations can now support authentication and SSL\/TLS. If authentication or SSL\/TLS are enabled in Kafka, see Apache Kafka Example 5 for how to enable configuration details on the Sysdig side. Two New Metrics for Accurate Pod Counts Two new Kubernetes metrics, kubernetes.namespace.pod.desired.count and kubernetes.namespace.pod.available.count, have been added at the Namespace level to track desired and available pod counts.

Some users implement these type of alerts for implementing workflows for image promotion, i.e. \"Push an image from staging to prod registry after a webhook is sent that the image was scanned and it passed.\" CVE Update - Be notified whenever a vulnerability is added, updated, or removed from an image within a registry. Repository Alerts Receive alerts about activity and changes that occur within your registry. See Manage Scanning Alerts . Slack Notifications Sample output of a CVE alert: Sample output of an image-analyzed alert: Image Scanning: Policies - New rule parameter available A new field: Max days since creation is now available. This allows users to only take Stop or Warn actions if a vulnerability has been in the feed for a certain number of days. For example: Only stop a build if an image has a high-severity CVE with a fix, and the CVE is more than 30 days old. Image Scanning: Policy Assignments - New compliance audits available Policy assignments now support the ability to add audit policies to provide a second step of validation of container images. Additional audit policies evaluate images against Dockerfile Best Practices, PCI, and NIST 800-190. These Audit policies have \"Warn\" actions set by default and are intended to validate compliance\/audit use cases and not cause CI\/CD builds to fail. Updated Menu Navigation in Sysdig Secure The top-menu navigation has been replaced by a context-sensitive drawer-style side navigation bar. Image Scanning: Scan Results Redesign Scan results have been expanded to help users get a better idea about the policy evaluation status and vulnerabilities present in an image. This new version of scan results allows the user to Get a breakdown of the different OS\/Non-OS Critical, High, Medium, Low CVEs present in the image See the different policies the image has been evaluated against See which specific rules have triggered the most stop\/warn actions and identify areas needing attention A breakdown of the evaluation result has been added to give users a better idea about what has triggered warn\/stop actions as part of the evaluation. In this case, we can look at the Dockerfile Best Practice policy to see the image Has an effective user of root Doesn't include a Healthcheck Uses apt-get upgrade as part of a Run instruction Includes an ADD instruction The Vulnerabilities section also now supports enhanced sorting and filtering by severity level and whether or not a fix is available.

Available under 'Notify' section of the alert configuration screen. See Alerts . Advanced Scope Selection The scope editor (for dashboards, alerts, teams, etc.) has added improved granularity, intelligent scope restriction, and the ability to add custom values on-the-fly. The editor now restricts the scope of the selection for subsequent filters by rendering values that are specific to the selected label. The values that are only relevant to the previous selection are displayed. For more information, see Dashboard Scope . Ability to Choose Unit of Metric Sysdig Monitor now automatically detects the type of input and scale for custom metrics. Earlier, custom metrics were marked as numbers on both Explore and Dashboard UI. The UI now supports custom unit scale for custom metrics. The supported units are byte, percent, and time. This enhancement simplifies the mapping of units of measurement with that of integrated application metrics, such as Prometheus. For more information, see Editing the Unit Scale . Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) metrics Support for the following HPA metrics has been introduced: kubernetes.hpa.replicas.min , kubernetes.hpa.replicas.max , k ubernetes.hpa.replicas.current , and k ubernetes.hpa.replicas.desired . For more information, see Resource Usage . Expose Dashboard Scope in URL The Dashboard URL can include scope parameters, including scope variables. Users can now share the URL with non-Sysdig Monitor users and allow them to collaborate on dashboard scope. Collaborators with a valid link can change the scope parameters without having to sign in.

Sysdig Secure Global Whitelists Sysdig Secure allows users to manage CVEs and images that may impact builds by defining them as globally trusted or blacklisted. See Global Whitelisting for more information. Kubernetes Audit Logging Sysdig Secure allows users to create Falco security rules based on a stream of Kubernetes audit events, integrating Kubernetes audit logging with the Sysdig Agent. This allows users to track changes made to the cluster, and send alerts where necessary. See Kubernetes Audit Logging for more information. Enhancements Manual PagerDuty Notification Channel Setup Sysdig has expanded the PagerDuty notification channel configuration process to allow users that have a team role of Manager, but a user role of Team Responder or lower, to manually configure the channel settings in order to add new channels. See PagerDuty Notifications for more details. Agent Installation Changes The default agent installation instructions in the UI have been updated to ensure all agents use SSL. If SSL is not required, the following JVM parameter will need to be set in the backend: (see Integrate JMX Metrics from Java Virtual Machines). -Ddraios.agents.installParams.sslEnabled=false Bug Fixes Anchore issue that caused scanning to hang when adding a registry An issue occurred where scanning stopped functioning when adding a new image scanning registry to an environment. This was caused by a bug found in the Anchore open-source engine. This on-premises release includes the approved workaround patch that corrects the issue. The next release of the Anchore open-source engine will include the full fix. Scanning service degradation due to orphaned services An issue occurred in systems with substantial churn where the event system became overloaded\/flooded with orphaned service events, resulting in service and performance degradation. This was caused by the Anchore engine emitting an event each time it found a service that was down\/orphaned. This issue has been resolved. Images with host\/port component weren't flagged with the correct analysis An issue occurred where images with a host\/port component were not flagged correctly, resulting in them showing as unscanned. This was caused by a bug in the scanning backend and has now been resolved. Scan alert e-mail An issue occurred in on-premises version 1765, where email alerts for scanning results directed users to an internal Sysdig environment, rather than their own. This has been corrected. Some panels in self-monitored dashboards not working An issue occurred where some panels in the Self-Monitored default dashboards were not displaying data correctly, because of an error in the default dashboard configuration file. This error has been corrected. Relocated \"Control Plane\" from Default Dashboard in Explore Kubernetes Control Plane Health dashboard has relocated to the Dashboards module. This dashboard allows users to monitor the health of Kubernetes master components ( kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager ). The Kubernetes Control Plane health dashboard has been removed from the list of default dashboards available under Resource Usage. ElasticSearch on Replicated Restarts into Split Brain When a customer restarted their Replicated environment, ElasticSearch sometimes came up in a split-brain scenario (generally 2 + 1). This issue has now been addressed. Install code lines for Sysdig Agent corrected On the Agent Installation page of the Sysdig UI, the supplied install strings for Docker and Linux were incorrect and would not work \"out of the box\" for a Replicated deployment.

This issue has been resolved. AWS data display issue For some AWS queries, data displayed incorrectly because the backend could not determine the AWS resource type being queried, so the aws.resource.type metadata was added to the request scope.

However, in instances where Sysdig goes down unexpectedly, or without proper shutdown\/startup procedures implemented, data can be missing, triggering alert notifications. A start-up delay in alert jobs can be configured in on-premises environments, by setting the draios.alerts.startupDelay parameter during the installation process. The parameter requires a duration value; the example below shows a duration of 10 minutes: draios.alerts.startupDelay=10m This parameter can be configured for either Replicated or Kubernetes environments: For Replicated environments, add the parameter to the Sysdig application JVM options list. For more information, refer to the Install Using the Replicated GUI documentation. For Kubernetes environments, add the parameter to the sysdigcloud.jvm.worker.options parameter in the configmap.

This has been corrected in the backend. Split brain in Elasticsearch when launching Kubernetes HA env A bug in the Elasticsearch container configuration created the potential for the nodes to fail to discover all of the members of their cluster at start-up. This resulted in a “split-brain” in the Elasticsearch cluster, where nodes created multiple separate clusters, instead of a single cohesive cluster. The configuration of the container was re-tooled to allow the Kubernetes cluster to expose the existence of the pods to their peers before they finish starting up, and the cluster pods will now be aware of all of the cluster members at start-up.
