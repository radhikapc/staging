The Activity Audit allows users to view different data sources in-depth for monitoring, troubleshooting, diagnostics, or to meet regulatory controls (SOC2, NIST, PCI, etc). Flexible filtering and scoping to help you focus on what’s relevant: Filters allow you to search, sort, and surface meaningful data and connections as they are needed. You can filter by data source type, data source attributes (like command name or Kubernetes user) and dynamic Kubernetes scope Automatically trace a kubectl exec session : The built-in trace functionality allows you to isolate and trace a kubectl exec access to a pod, automatically correlating the original Kubernetes user and IP that accessed the pod with the activity that was performed during the interactive session, including commands and network connections.

"body" : "With the Kubernetes Policy Advisor, Sysdig Secure auto-generates Pod Security Policies (PSPs) to significantly decrease the time spent configuring Kubernetes Policies. Strict security policies reduce risk, but can also break applications. Sysdig tests the impact of pod security policies through simulations, enabling teams to adjust misconfigurations before shifting to production. There are three main features that comprise the Kubernetes Policy Advisor: Auto generation: Sysdig Secure can parse any Kubernetes yaml file that includes a pod spec to generate a tailor-made PSP based on the configuration. Simulations: Start a simulation of the auto-generated PSP or any user-inputted PSP to see what pods would have been blocked from running if this PSP had been actively applied to the cluster. Events and tuning: Each pod\/activity that would have violated the PSP will generate an event. Within the event details, users can see information about potential modifications they may need to make to the policy or the pod configuration. " },

New Prometheus Client Version Updated  prometheus_client  to version 0.7.1. This should result in improved performance while ingesting Prometheus metrics. Fix for dropping StatsD Metrics A defect in earlier versions of Sysdig Monitor with the statsd.use_forwarder option could drop some StatsD metrics from containers. This change resolves that problem; the agent will begin fetching metrics from containers 10 seconds after first identifying that the container exists. The 10 second delay allows containers to start StatsD servers within their network namespaces if they choose. The timeout can be overridden using the statsd.container_server_creation_delay_s option, which specifies the delay in seconds.

Fixed limit\/requests calculations for init containers Fixed memory calculations for Kubernetes init container limits and requests Improved Healthcheck monitoring Agent has improved ability to detect commands identified as a part of Kubernetes Liveness\/Readiness Probes, in addition to Docker Health Checks. Improved error messaging Warning messages for container group inconsistencies were demoted to debug level, as they are harmless and do not need to clutter the error reporting stream. Fixed issue with container \"incomplete\" reporting status Starting with version 0.90.0, the agent would report containers for which it had not yet fetched metadata as \"incomplete.\" This would then propagate to the Monitor UI. This restores the behavior where the agent leaves the unknown fields unset. Resolved REST server issue Fixed problem where an enabled port would respond to HTTP requests when not desired. Fixed issue with StatsD metrics collection Previous versions of the Sysdig agent, when configured to use the StatsD fowarder ( {{statsd.use_forwarder: true}} ) truncated messages that it received from containers to 2048 bytes, resulting in the potential for dropped and corrupted metrics.

Strict security policies reduce risk, but can also break applications. Sysdig tests the impact of pod security policies through simulations, enabling teams to adjust misconfigurations before shifting to production. There are three main features that comprise the Kubernetes Policy Advisor: Auto generation: Sysdig Secure can parse any Kubernetes yaml file that includes a pod spec to generate a tailor-made PSP based on the configuration. Simulations: Start a simulation of the auto-generated PSP or any user-inputted PSP to see what pods would have been blocked from running if this PSP had been actively applied to the cluster. Events and tuning: Each pod\/activity that would have violated the PSP will generate an event. Within the event details, users can see information about potential modifications they may need to make to the policy or the pod configuration. " },

Several factors could cause the pods to stuck in the Pending state: Pods make requests for resources that exceed what’s available across the nodes (the remaining allocatable pods). Pods make requests higher than the availability of every single node. For example, you have 8-core Nodes and you create a pod with a 16-core request. These pods might require reconfiguration and specific setup related to Node affinity and anti-affinity constraints. Namespace quota is reached before making a high resource request. If a quota is enforced at the Namespace level, you may hit the limit independent of the resource availability across the Nodes. " },

"body" : "This topic gives insight into the metrics displayed on the Workloads Overview page. Pod Restarts The chart displays the latest value returned by sum(timeAvg(kubernetes.pod.restart.rate)) . What Is It? The sparkline shows the trend of Pod Restarts rate across all the pods in a selected Workload. The number shows the most recent rate, expressed in Restarts per Second. For instance, the image below shows the trend for the last hour. The number indicates that the rate of pod restarts is less than 0.01 for the last 10 minutes. For reference, the sparklines show the following number of steps (sampling): Last hour : 6 steps, each for a 10-minute time slice. Last 6 hours : 12 steps, each for a 20-minute time slice. Last day : 12 steps, each for a 2-hour time slice. What to Expect? A healthy pod will have 0 restarts at any given time. What to Do Otherwise? In most cases, fewer restarts in the last hour (or larger time windows) do not indicate a serious problem. Drill down to the Kubernetes Overview Dashboard related to the Workload in Explore . For example, Kubernetes StatefulSet Overview provides a detailed trend broken down by pods. In this example, the number of restarts is constant (roughly every 5 minutes) and no pods are ready. This might indicate a crash loop back-off . Pods Available vs Desired The chart shows the latest value of returned by sum(avg(kubernetes.deployment.replicas.available)) \/ sum(avg(kubernetes.deployment.replicas.desired)) . What Is It? The chart displays the ratio between available and desired pods, averaged across the selected time window, for all the pods in a given Workload. The upper bound shows the number of desired pods in the Workload. For instance, the image below shows all the 42 desired pods are available. What to Expect? You should typically expect 100%. If certain pods take a significant amount of time to become available (image pull time, pod initialization, readiness probe), then you may temporarily see a ratio lower than 100%. What to Do Otherwise? Determine the Workloads that have low availability by drilling down to the related Dashboard in Explore . For example, the Kubernetes Deployment Overview helps understand the trend and the state of the pods. For instance, the image above shows that the ratio is 98% (3.93 \/ 4 x 100). The slight decline is due to an update that caused pods to be terminated and consequently to be started with a newer version. CPU Used vs Requests The chart shows the latest value returned by sum(avg(cpu.cores.used)) \/ sum(avg(kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.cpuCores)) . Memory Used vs Requests The chart shows the latest value returned by sum(avg(memory.bytes.used)) \/ sum(avg(kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memBytes)) . What Is It? The chart shows the ratio between the total memory usage across all the pods in a Workload and the total memory requested by the Workload. The upper bound shows the total memory requested by all the pods, expressed in the specified unit of bytes. For instance, the image shows that the pods in the selected Workload requested for 120 GiB, of which 24% is actually used (about 29 GiB). What to Expect? The type of Workload determines the ratio. Values between 80% and 120% are considered normal. Values that are higher than 100% is deemed normal if it's observed only for a relatively short time. What to Do Otherwise? A low memory usage indicates that the application is not properly running (not executing the expected functions) or the Workload configuration is not accurate (requests are too high compared to what the pods actually need). A high memory usage indicates that the load is higher for applications or the Workload configuration is not accurate (low requests compared to what the pods actually need). Given the configured limits for the Workloads and the memory pressure on the nodes, if the Workloads use more memory than what’s requested they are at risk of eviction. For more information, see Container's Memory Limit . In either case, drill down to the Workloads page to determine the Workload that requires a deeper analysis. Can the Value Be Higher than 100%? Yes, it can. Configuring memory requests without limits or requests lower than limits is permissible. In these cases, you are allowing the containers to use more resources than requested, typically to handle temporary overloads. Consider a Workload with two containers. Say, one container is configured to request for 1 GiB of memory and uses 1 GiB (Used vs Request ratio is 100%), while the other is configured without any request and uses 1 GiB of memory. In this example, the 2 GiB of memory used to 1 GiB requested ratio is 200% at the Workload level. What Does “No Data” Mean? If the Workload is configured with no memory requests and limits, then the Usage vs Requests ratio cannot be computed. In this case, the chart will show “no data”. Drill down to the Dashboard in Explore to evaluate the actual usage. You must configure requests. It helps to detect Workloads that require reconfiguration. Kubernetes itself might expose Workloads with no requests or limits configured. For example, the kube-system Namespace can have Workloads without requests configured. Network I\/O The chart shows the latest value returned by avg(avg(net.bytes.total)) . What Is It? The sparkline shows the trend of network traffic (inbound and outbound) for the Workload. The number shows the most recent rate, expressed in bytes per second in a specific unit. For reference, the sparklines show the following number of steps (sampling): Last hour : 6 steps, each for a 10-minute time slice Last 6 hours : 12 steps, each for a 30-minute time slice Last day : 12 steps, each for a 2-hour time slice What to Expect? The type of application runs in the Workload determines the metrics. Drill down to the Kubernetes Overview Dashboard corresponding to the Workload in Explore . For example, the Kubernetes Deployment Overview Dashboard provides additional details, such as network activity across pods. " },

"body" : "Sysdig Monitor imports data related to entities such as hosts, containers, processes, and so on, and reports them in tables or panels on the Explore and Dashboards UI, as well as in events, so across the UI you see varieties of data. The term n\/a can appear anywhere on the UI where some form of data is displayed. n\/a is a term that indicates data that is not available or that it does not apply to a particular instance. In Sysdig parlance, the term signifies one or more entities defined by a particular label, such as hostname or Kubernetes service, for which the label is invalid. In other words, n\/a collectively represent entities whose metadata is not relevant to aggregation and filtering techniques—Grouping, Scoping, and Segmenting. For instance, a list of Kubernetes services might display the list of all the services as well as n\/a that includes all the containers without the metadata describing a Kubernetes service. You might encounter n\/a sporadically in Explore table as well as in drill-down panels or dashboards, events, and likely elsewhere on the Sysdig Monitor UI when no relevant metadata is available for that particular display. How n\/a should be treated depends on the nature of your deployment. The deployment will not be affected by the entities marked n\/a. The following are some of the cases that yield n\/a on the UI: Labels are partially available or not available. For example, a host has entities that are not associated with a monitored Kubernetes deployment, or a monitored host has an unmonitored Kubernetes deployment running. Labels that do not apply to the grouping criteria or at the hierarchy level. For example: Containers that are not managed by Kubernetes. The containers managed by Kubernetes are identified with their  container.name labels. In certain groupings by DaemonSet, Deployments render N\/A and vice versa. Not all containers belong to both DaemonSet and Deployment objects concurrently. Likewise, a Kubernetes ReplicaSet grouping with the  kubernetes.replicaset.name  label will not show StatefulSets. In a  kubernetes.cluster.name > kubernetes.namespace.name > kubernetes.deployment.name  grouping, the entities without the  kubernetes.cluster.name label yield n\/a. Entities are incorrectly labeled in the infrastructure. Kubernetes features that are yet to be in sync with Sysdig Monitoring. The format is not applicable to a particular record in the database.

Sysdig Monitor maintains an index of all the custom metrics and the custom labels that have reported data in the last 14 days. Each indexed metric\/label is available when configuring new or existing artifacts, i.e. dashboards, scopes, alerts, and so on. When the system does not receive any data for a metric\/label for more than 14 days, or a metric\/label is found that has never reported data (for example, it was never added to the metric index), it is removed from the index if present, and marked as missing . Missing metrics are different from instances where a panel\/dashboard states that \" Metric data is not available \". A missing metric\/label is still available for data queries and charts. Existing artifacts are not affected. However, it is not possible to configure new artifacts with a missing metric\/label, or to update existing artifacts unless the missing metrics\/labels are removed from the configuration.

"body" : "Time aggregation comes into effect in two overlapping situations: Charts can only render a limited number of data points. To look at a wide range of data, Sysdig Monitor may need to aggregate granular data into larger samples for visualization. Sysdig Monitor rolls up historical data over time. Sysdig retains rollups based on each aggregation type, to allow users to choose which data points to utilize when evaluating older data. Sysdig agents collect 1-second samples and report data at 10-second resolution. The data is stored and reported every 10-second with the available aggregations (average, rate, min, max, sum) to make them available via the Sysdig Monitor UI and the API. For time series charts covering five minutes or less, data points are drawn at this 10-second resolution, and any time aggregation selections will have no effect. When an amount of time greater than five minutes is displayed, data points are drawn as an aggregate for an appropriate time interval. For example, for a chart covering one hour, each data point would reflect a one minute interval. At time intervals of one minute and above, charts can be configured to display different aggregates for the 10-second metrics used to calculate each datapoint. Aggregation Type Description average The average of the retrieved metric values across the time period. rate The average value of the metric across the time period evaluated. maximum The highest value during the time period evaluated. minimum The lowest value during the time period evaluated. sum The combined sum of the metric across the time period evaluated. In the example images below, the kubernetes.deployment.replicas.available metrics first uses the average for time aggregation: Then uses the sum for time aggregation: Rate and average are very similar and often provide the same result. However, the calculation of each is different. If time aggregation is set to one minute, the agent is supposed to retrieve six samples (one every 10 seconds). In some cases, samples may not be there, due to disconnections or other circumstances. For this example, four samples are available. If this was the case, the average would be calculated by dividing by four, while the rate would be calculated by dividing by six. Most metrics are sampled once for each time interval, resulting in average and rate returning the same value. However, there will be a distinction for any metrics not reported at every time interval. For example, some custom statsd metrics. Rate is currently referred to as timeAvg in the Sysdig Monitor API and advanced alerting language. By default, average is used when displaying data points for a time interval. " },

For example, three hosts report different CPU usage for one sample interval. The three values will be averaged, and reported on the chart as a single datapoint for that metric. There are several different types of group aggregation: Aggregation Type Description average The average value of the interval's samples. maximum The maximum value of the interval's samples. minimum The minimum value of the interval's samples. sum The combined value of all of the interval's samples. If a chart or alert is segmented, the group aggregation settings will be utilized for both aggregations across the whole group, and aggregation within each individual segmentation. For example, the image below shows a chart for CPU% across the infrastructure: When segmented by proc.name , the chart shows one CPU% line for each process: Each line provides the average value for every process with the same name. To see the difference, change the group aggregation type to sum: The metric aggregation value showed beside the metric name is for the time aggregation.

In the example below, the CPU% metric is applied to a group of servers called webserver . The first chart shows metrics using average aggregation for both time and group. The second chart shows the metrics using maximum aggregation for both time and group. For each one minute interval, the second chart renders the highest CPU usage value found from the servers in the webserver group and from all of the samples reported during the one minute interval. This view can be useful when searching for transient spikes in metrics over long periods of time, that would otherwise be missed with average aggregation.

"body" : "Topology View provides an interactive, animated interface to visualize how different components in your system interact with each other in real time. The interface by default renders a selected host's top processes and their interaction with processes on remote hosts or host groups. Entities in any valid logical grouping can be visually represented with Topology View. The interaction is depicted as nodes and links. Links connect nodes. Nodes and links radially expand from the left. Nodes : The entities participating in network communication. A node could be a process, a container, a host, or any label identified by Sysdig Agent. For example: kubernetes.pod.name. Links : The network connection between nodes. Hosts and their child processes ( host.hostName > proc.name) serve as the default grouping for the Topology View. Scaling a Topology View is limited by the number of processes and connections. Sysdig Monitor creates the Topology View by identifying network endpoints (IP addresses) derived from system call data. Topology View in the Explore tab provides pre-defined dashboards to represent CPU Usage , Network Traffic , and Response Time metrics, and as such, they are not configurable. It serves as a template diagnostic tool that provides bottom-up inter-process connection metrics as graphs. For a detailed description on each default metric type supported by the Topology View, see Topology Dashboards . " },

"body" : "The UI allows you to zoom in, zoom out, fit, pan, and reset the display, and expand and collapse the nodes. Zoom into an entity by clicking the associated + icon and view the top processes within the selected entity. You can expand the hosts to see individual processes running inside and corresponding metric value. The links indicating network connections are rendered between entities in the selected hierarchy and, when zoomed, between processes and entities. Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom the content, then left-click and drag to move the map components within the window. Topology View uses legends and color schemes. This section explains what they mean. The line width (thickness) of the links expresses metric values relative to other connections in the system. Scaling line width is relative to the metric values associated with each link. Topology View dynamically adjusts the legend as the data recorded for each connection changes. The thin black line(—): Lower metric values. The thick black line( — ): Higher metric values. Dashed lines(---): A previously existed connection. For example, an active connection between node A and B, rendered as a solid line, could dissolve after a data update if that connection does not exist anymore in the new data set. Instead of removing it from the graph, Sysdig Monitor depicts the inactive connection as a dotted line until the next data update. If the connection returns in a subsequent data update, it is rendered again as a solid line. If the connection does not exist, the line will be removed. The color scheme is determined by color coding for the customizable threshold. The nodes are identified by five colors: Green indicates the node is healthy. Yellow indicates the node is in a warning state. Red indicates the node is in a critical state. Grey indicates the node state is unknown. An unknown node typically signifies a node where no Sysdig Agent installed. Light Blue indicates no threshold is defined for the metrics. " },

"body" : "The Kubernetes * Health dashboards break down resource and performance metrics by various logical entities to allow for an in-depth analysis, and for critical issues to be identified and isolated. Each dashboard is built around the Golden Signals approach to monitoring: Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation. Resource utilization metrics are oriented toward health and performance. These are aspects like CPU, memory, network, and storage usage by Kubernetes object. kube-state-metrics is about the status or count. Pairing kube-state-metrics with resource utilization metrics, each dashboard provides a comprehensive picture of what’s happening in your Kubernetes environment. Dashboard Description Use Cases Kubernetes Cluster Overview Provides an overview of your Kubernetes cluster. Identify performance bottlenecks. Locate logical entities that are consuming too many cluster resources, or that are rapidly trending upwards towards unsustainable levels. Dive deeper into specific entities to identify the root cause of problems. Use usage percentages over time to better estimate expansion capacity. For example: A deployment with no available pods indicates that the corresponding app is not serving requests. Getting a dashboard on this condition means you can visualize the metrics and spring into action to find and resolve the issue quickly. Dropping the number of pods available and remaining below the desired number indicate that your application performance is degraded or not running at the redundancy required. With these metrics represented on the dashboard, you get a quick glance of the severity of the impact on your app's user experience. A lower number of replicas running during an extended period of time than the number of replicas desired indicates a symptom of entities not working properly, such as nodes or resources unavailability, Kubernetes or Docker Engine failure, broken Docker images, and so on. No replicas for a deployment object could potentially mean that the app is down. A continuous loop of pod restart (CrashLoopBackOff) might be associated with missing dependencies or unmet requirements, or insufficient resources. In CrashLoopBackOff, pods never get into ready status and therefore are counted as unavailable and down. Kubernetes Deployment Overview Highlights whether each deployment has a sufficient number of available pods and resources, and indicates the number of pods running, desired, or have been updated. Kubernetes Namespace Overview Displays metrics such as resource requests and resource limits at the namespace level; identifies the performance of the Kubernetes entities such as pods, deployments, DaemonSet, Statefulset, and jobs, and compliance with replicaSets specs. Highlights the number of services, deployments, replicaSets, and jobs per namespace. Kubernetes Node Overview Highlights the number of nodes that are ready, unavailable, or out of disk; the number of nodes that are under the memory, disk, or network pressure; compares allocatable capacity with requested capacity on the node; provides the number of pod resources of a node that are available for scheduling and the available capacity to serve the pods running on the nodes. Kubernetes Pod Overview Helps identify potential bottlenecks by graphing the number of container restarts, the number of pods waiting to be scheduled, resource utilization of containers within each pod and available capacity to serve pod requests, the number of available pods compared to the desired pods, and the number of pods in available state and ready to serve requests. Kubernetes StatefulSet Overview Overview of the StatefulSet objects in your environment. Kubernetes DaemonSet Overview Overview of DaemonSet objects. Kubernetes Job Overview Overview of all the jobs and the performance information. Kubernetes ReplicaSet Overview Provides details such as the number of pods per replicaSet, the desired number of pods per replicaSet, and pods per replicaSet that are in a ready state. Workloads CPU Usage and Allocation Displays resource utilization of your workloads. Workloads Memory Usage and Allocation Displays memory utilization of your workloads. CPU Allocation Optimization Highlights CPU allocation optimization. Memory Allocation Optimization Highlights Memory allocation optimization. Kubernetes Health Overview Provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of the entire Kubernetes environment, broken down by various logical entities and underlying resource availability and usage. This dashboard breaks down resource and performance kube-state-metrics by the logical Kubernetes entities, such as pods, namespaces, deployments, and replicaSets, containers, and so on. Use these three dashboards to provide a high-level overview of all aspects of the Kubernetes environment's performance and resource saturation status. Set high-level alerts to narrow down areas of concern, before moving to the more in-depth dashboards. Quickly identify major performance issues within each type of entity. Kubernetes Cluster and Node Capacity Highlights a comprehensive overview of the performance of the hosts or nodes that form the Kubernetes cluster, including CPU, memory, and file system usage, and network traffic. Before analyzing the Dashboard, consider the following guidelines related to resource usage: If Resource Limits is undefined for a container, Kubernetes does not default to a value. if Resource Requests is unspecified for a container, Kubernetes defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Limits do not default to any value. If both Resource Limits and Resource Requests are not specified, no matter which value had been defaulted by Kubernetes, kube-state-metric (and hence Sysdig Monitor) reports zero. Therefore, only user-defined requested are reported by the kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte metric . The memory used by a container (the value returned by memory.used.bytes) can be greater than the memory requested by a pod (the value returned by kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte) . This is permissible in Kubernetes because Requests value determines the minimum amount of resources required. For these reasons, it can be deduced that In some cases, the value of Used Resources will be more than that of Resource Requests and Resource Limits, and the value of Resource RequestS could be more than that of Resource Limit. The value of kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte <= memory.used.bytes <= kubernetes.pod.resourceLimits.memByte " },

Configuring Table Panel Major features include but not limited to : Queries The first query you build cannot be removed. With subsequent queries are built, you cannot remove all the queries except the first one. Changing the unit of the query changes the unit in the table as well. Changing the display format on the query reflects on the row values. Segmentation The segmentation label determines the column name. The segmentation in conjunction with metric values determines the values displayed on the rows. Scope The selected scope determines the values displayed on the table. Metrics Adding a new query insert a new column with the name of the metric as the column heading. Metric values in conjunction with segmentation determine the values displayed on the rows. Sorting Column sorting is based on the selected column header and the type of sorting (ascending and descending). When another column is sorted, the table is resorted by that column, resetting the previous sorting. Resizing Grab the header column by the borderline to resize the columns. Browser window resizes shouldn’t reset the resize of the columns if you have resized any columns. When resizing the browser window, table columns are resized to cover the full width.

"body" : "Steps Description Decide What to monitor Determine what type of problem you want to be alerted on. See Alert Types to choose a type of problem. Define how it will be monitored Specify exactly what behavior triggers a violation. For example, Marathon App is down on the Kubernetes Cluster named Production for ten minutes. Decide Where to monitor Narrow down your environment to receive fine-tuned results. Use Scope to choose an entity that you want to keep a close watch on. Specify additional segments (entities) to give context to the problem. For example, in addition to specifying a Kubernetes cluster, add a namespace and deployment to refine your scope. Define when to notify Define the threshold and time window for assessing the alert condition. Single Alert fires an alert for your entire scope, while Multiple Alert fires if any or every segment breach the threshold at once. Multiple Alerts include all the segments you specified to uniquely identify the location and thus provides full qualification of where the problem occurred. The higher the number of segments the easier to uniquely identify the affected entities. A good analogy for multiple alerts is alerting on cities. For example, creating multiple alerts on San Francisco would trigger an alert which will include information such as the country that it is part of is the USA and the continent is North America. Trigger gives you control over how notifications are created. For example, you may want to receive a notification for every violation, or want only a single notification for a series of consecutive violations. Decide how notifications are sent Alert supports customizable notification channels, including email, mobile push notifications, OpsGenie, Slack, and more. To see supported services, see . Set Up Notification Channels To create alerts, simply: Choose an Alert Type . Configure alert parameters . Configure the notification channels you want to use for alert notification. Set Up Notification Channels Sysdig sometimes deprecates outdated metrics. Alerts that use these metrics will not be modified or disabled, but will no longer be updated. See .

Role delegation is an alternative to the existing integration method using the access keys. This method is considered secure as sharing developer access keys with third-parties is not recommended by Amazon. " },

Specifically, the metadata URL will be of the format https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/FederationMetadata\/2007-06\/FederationMetadata.xml . Also, so that the Sysdig platform can access this URL directly, this host must resolve in DNS and have a valid ( not self-signed) SSL\/TLS certificate. Add a Relying Party Trust configuration for the Sysdig application. Right-click to Relying Party Trusts > Add Relying Party Trust and click Start to begin the wizard. In the Select Data Source step, click the button to Enter data about the relying party manually , then click Next Enter a Display name of your choosing (e.g. \"Sysdig Monitor\" or \"Sysdig Secure\"), then click Next Click Next to accept the default option to use AD FS profile Click Next to skip the selection of an optional token encryption certificate (Sysdig does not support this option) Check the box to Enable support for the SAML 2.0 Web SSO protocol , then enter one of the following values for Relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URL : If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter: https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/saml\/auth If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter: https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com\/api\/saml\/secureAuth Then click Next. For the Relying party trust identifier , enter one of the following values: If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter: https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter: https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com Then click Add , then click Next Click Next to skip configuration of multi-factor authentication Choose a policy for whether users will be permitted to login to the Sysdig application. The default to Permit all users to access the relying party will typically be acceptable. Click Next . Review the summary and click Next to complete the configuration of the Relying Party Trust The next step will involve adding Claim Rules, so you can leave the box checked to Open the Edit Claim Rules dialog and click the Close button to be brought immediately into the Claim Rules editor Ensure that the SamlResponseSignature option matches the Sysdig authentication configuration. Use the Set-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust\/Get-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust  cmdlets via PowerShell to configure SamlResponseSignature . -SamlResponseSignature\nSpecifies the response signatures that the relying party expects. The acceptable values for this parameter are:\n\nAssertionOnly\nMessageAndAssertion\nMessageOnly For more information, see Set-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust . Navigate to Settings > Authentication on the Sysdig app and check the Sysdig authentication setting maps to the SamlResponseSignature : For MessageAndAssertion , enable both the options. Next, use the Claim Rules to ensure that login data is sent as needed to the Sysdig platform. A user's login to the Sysdig platform is based on an email address, and a default ADFS configuration would not send the email address as required. The following configuration ensures the correct field from Active Directory is delivered in the claim. If not already in the Claim Rules editor from the previous step, navigate to it by right-clicking on the Relying Party Trust that was just created and selecting Edit Claim Rules Click Add Rule . At the following screen, accept the default rule template to Send LDAP Attributes as Claims and click Next . Enter a name for the rule, select Active Directory as the Attribute store , then use the pull-down selectors to pick E-Mail Address as both the LDAP Attribute and Outgoing Claim Type , then similarly make pull-down selections for Given Name and Surname . Once these selections are made, click Finish . Now click Add Rule again, this time selecting the template for Transform an incoming claim Enter a name for the rule, then use the pull-downs to select an Incoming claim type of E-Mail Address , an Outgoing claim type of Name ID , and an Outgoing name ID format of Email , then click Finish . (Optional) If you want the user's First Name and Last Name to be included in the records created in the Sysdig platform database when new users successfully login via SAML for the first time, additional Transform rules must also be created. Only the email-based username is strictly required and we already created a rule for this, so this step is optional. If you wish to do this, click Add Rule and once again select the template for Transform an incoming claim . Enter a name for the rule, then use the pull-down to select an Incoming claim type of Given Name , and for the Outgoing claim type , directly type first name into the field. After clicking Finish , click Add Rule and create a similar rule to transform the Incoming claim type of Surname to the Outgoing claim type of last name . Having clicked Finish after creating your last rule, you will see all rules now in the editor. You can click Ok , and your ADFS configuration for your Sysdig application is complete. It can be tested once Sysdig Support has completed their side of the configuration using the metadata URL you send in your Support request. " },

"body" : "(Optional) The steps above represent a Service-Provider-Initiated SAML configuration. If you would prefer an IdP-initiated SAML configuration, this is also possible with ADFS, but requires the additional steps described below. The Sysdig platform requires a specific setting of RelayState in order to accept IdP-initiated login flows. On the ADFS versions tested, we've found this use of RelayState is disabled by default, and a Microsoft article describes the topic in detail. To enable it, as described in a Microsoft forum thread , on your ADFS host, edit %systemroot%\\ADFS\\Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config and add <useRelayStateForIdpInitiatedSignOn enabled=\"true\" \/> to the <microsoft.identityserver.web> section. Once the modification is saved, restart ADFS services for the change to take effect. You will need to retrieve your Sysdig customer number as described in the Find Your Customer Number article. Find Your Customer Number You will then need to generate an IdP-initiated login URL. In addition to having the correct settings, it must be properly URL encoded. To ease this configuration, use this ADFS RelayState Generator tool. When launched, enter the values below, then hit the Generate URL button. For the IDP URL String , enter https:\/\/YOUR_ADFS_SERVER\/adfs\/ls\/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx For the Relying Party Identifier , enter one of the following values: If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com For the Relay State\/Target App , enter #\/&customer=CUSTOMER-ID-NUMBER , substituting the CUSTOMER-ID-NUMBER you retrieved in the previous step This Results URL will be used in the metadata URL that you paste in the Metadata entry in the SAML connection settings . SAML (SaaS) Use the Results URL from the tool to test your IdP-initiated login. Note that per this Microsoft forum thread , it is apparently not possible to configure ADFS to use such a URL when your users select the application from the pull-down menu at https:\/\/YOUR_ADFS_SERVER\/adfs\/ls\/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx . However, you may embed the URL into a custom portal or bookmarks list. Now you can test login using an Active Directory user that has an Email address configured. " },
