This improves performance and prevents cluttering the system with short-lived container or metric names. Sysdig Monitor maintains an index of all custom metrics and custom labels that have reported data in the last 14 days. Each indexed metric\/label is available when configuring new or existing artifacts (i.e. dashboards, scopes, alerts etc). When the system does not receive any data for a metric\/label for more than 14 days, or a metric\/label is found that has never reported data (for example, it was never added to the metric index), it is removed from the index if present, and marked as missing . Missing metrics are different to instances where a panel\/dashboard states that \" Metric data is not available \". A missing metric\/label is still available for data queries and charts. Existing artifacts are not affected. However, it is not possible to configure new artifacts with a missing metric\/label, or to update existing artifacts unless the missing metrics\/labels are removed from the configuration. If new data is received for a missing metric\/label, we put it back into the index and the above limitations are removed. What You See in the UI: If you configured a dashboard three months ago and a metric in it is now missing, when you go to the dashboard and update it in the dashboard settings, a warning appears below the metric stating that the metric is missing.

"body" : " Time Aggregation Group Aggregation Aggregation Examples Time Aggregation Time aggregation comes into effect in two overlapping situations: Charts can only render a limited number of data points. To look at a wide range of data, Sysdig Monitor may need to aggregate granular data into larger samples for visualization. Sysdig Monitor rolls up historical data over time. Sysdig retains rollups based on each aggregation type, to allow users to choose which datapoints to utilize when evaluating older data. By default, Sysdig agents collect and report metrics at a 10 second resolution. For time series charts covering five minutes or less, datapoints are drawn at this 10 second resolution, and any time aggregation selections will have no effect. When an amount of time greater than five minutes is displayed, data points are drawn as an aggregate for an appropriate time interval. For example, for a chart covering one hour, each datapoint would reflect a one minute interval. At time intervals of one minute and above, charts can be configured to display different aggregates for the 10 second metrics used to calculate each datapoint. Aggregation Type Description average The average of the retrieved metric values across the time period. rate The average value of the metric across the time period evaluated. maximum The highest value during the time period evaluated. minimum The lowest value during the time period evaluated. sum The combined sum of the metric across the time period evaluated. In the example images below, the kubernetes.deployment.replicas.available metrics first uses the average for time aggregation, and then uses the sum for time aggregation: Rate and average are very similar, and often provide the same result. However, the calculation of each is different. If time aggregation is set to one minute, the agent is supposed to retrieve six samples (one every 10 seconds). In some cases, samples may not be there, due to disconnections or other circumstances. For this example, four samples are available. If this was the case, the average would be calculated by dividing by four, while the rate would be calculated by dividing by six. Most metrics are sampled once for each time interval, resulting in average and rate returning the same value. However, there will be a distinction for any metrics not reported at every time interval (for example, some custom statsd metrics). Rate is currently referred to as timeAvg in the Sysdig Monitor API and advanced alerting language. By default, average is used when displaying datapoints for a time interval. Group Aggregation Metrics applied to a group of items (for example, several containers, hosts, or nodes) are averaged between the members of the group by default. For example, three hosts report different CPU usage for one sample interval. The three values will be averaged, and reported on the chart as a single datapoint for that metric. There are several different types of group aggregation: Aggregation Type Description average The average value of the interval's samples. maximum The maximum value of the interval's samples. minimum The minimum value of the interval's samples. sum The combined value of all of the interval's samples. If a chart or alert is segmented, the group aggregation settings will be utilized for both aggregation across the whole group, and aggregation within each individual segmentation. For example, the image below shows a chart for CPU% across the infrastructure: When segmented by proc.name , the chart shows one CPU% line for each process: Each line provides the average value for every process with the same name. To see the difference, change the group aggregation type to sum: The metric aggregation value showed beside the metric name is for the time aggregation. While the screenshot shows AVG , the group aggregation is set to SUM . Aggregation Examples The tables below provide an example of how each type of aggregation works. The first table provides the metric data, while the second displays the resulting value for each type of aggregation. In the example below, the CPU% metric is applied to a group of servers called webserver . The first chart shows metrics using average aggregation for both time and group. The second chart shows the metrics using maximum aggregation for both time and group. For each one minute interval, the second chart renders the highest CPU usage value found from the servers in the webserver group and from all of the samples reported during the one minute interval. This view can be useful when searching for transient spikes in metrics over long periods of time, that would otherwise be missed with average aggregation. The group aggregation type is dependent on the segmentation. For a view showing metrics for a group of items, the current group aggregation setting will revert to the default setting, if the Segment By selection is changed. " },

"body" : "For policy events local to the environment, the first step to address them is by adding custom Falco rules via the Rules Editor tab of the Policies module. These additions will extend or overwrite the behavior of a list, macro, or rule from the default rules section, in order to address the false positive. A number of rules have a macro with the prefix user_, that can be overridden in the custom rules section in order to change the behavior of a rule. Some examples include: user_known_write_etc_conditions user_read_sensitive_file_conditions user_known_change_thread_namespace_binaries user_shell_container_exclusions user_trusted_containers user_sensitive_mount_containers If a user_ macro is not available, Sysdig recommends appending changes to an existing list, macro, or rule, instead of overwriting them. Overwritten lists, macros, and rules will remain static when the default rules are updated. This could lead to new default rules being shadowed and inaccessible to the user. The specific changes necessary to the Falco rules depend heavily on the policy that triggered the false positives. A few examples are shown below: Write below etc For the Write Below etc policy, there may be an additional program that writes specific file(s) below \/etc (this example uses the program catsd , and the file \/etc\/catfood.cfg ). A macro could then be defined as follows: - macro: catsd_writing_catfood_cfg\n condition: (proc.name=catsd and fd.name=\/etc\/catfood.cfg) In addition, the macro user_known_write_etc_conditions would need to be overwritten to add a new exception: - macro: user_known_write_etc_conditions\n condition: catsd_writing_catfood_cfg Launch Privileged Container For the Launch Privileged Container policy, there may be a specific container that must run with privileges. The example macro below uses images starting with registry.customer.com\/mydatastore , and overrides the user_trusted_containers macro: - macro: user_trusted_containers\n condition: (container.image startswith registry.customer.com\/mydatastore) Run shelluntrusted For the Run shelluntrusted policy, a program may be present that spawns shells in the environment for legitimate purposes. The example below appends php to the list of known shell spawn binaries, using the user_known_shell_spawn_binaries list: - list: user_known_shell_spawn_binaries\n append: true\n items: [php] For more information on creating Falco rules, refer to the Falco Rules documentation.

"body" : "The example walkthrough below covers modifying a policy and the underlying rules to whitelist a container, in order to minimize false positive results. Identify the Container \/ Image to Whitelist The container\/image can be identified either from the Sysdig Secure UI (if an event has already been triggered), or directly from the host. From the Sysdig Secure UI To find the container \/ image: From the Policy Events module, use the left-hand drill-down menu to identify the object to whitelist. In this example, the desired object is one of the built-in Kubernetes components (k8s_kube-addon-manager): Using the drill-down menu is not strictly necessary, as all of the information is contained within the Policy Event Details window. However, using the drill-down menu can help verify the correct object to whitelist. Click on the relevant event to open the Policy Event Details window to review the event details, and identify the object to be whitelisted. In this example, the image is a sha256 digest as it is an internal component of Kubernetes, so the container name should be used instead, in case the component is upgraded at a later date. A variety of metadata can be used for whitelisting. For containers, container name, image name, or digest could be used. Container name is the most common approach, but this option could be spoofed. Image name (such as sysdig\/agent) is a more secure option. Using the digest is the most secure option as the source is guaranteed, but may require an automated solution to ensure the platform continues to whitelist the object correctly after component updates. Identify the name of the policy rule triggered by the object: From the Host CLI To find the container \/ image: In a terminal on the host, run the following command: The example command below limits the output of docker ps to only provide the relevant information, as it is only seeking the container name or source image. \nuser@host:~$ docker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Image}}\" For larger lists, either use more|less or grep to find the specific object. In the example output below, grep is used to find addon , as the desired image is k8s_kube-addon-manager . The command also includes the table headings: \nuser@host:~$ docker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Image}}\" | grep 'addon\\|NAME' | more\nNAMES IMAGE\nk8s_kube-addon-manager_kube-addon-manager-minikube_kube-system_8b52f08746ac78d32737b5f7fdffec52_3 9c16409588eb\nk8s_POD_kube-addon-manager-minikube_kube-system_8b52f08746ac78d32737b5f7fdffec52_3 k8s.gcr.io\/pause-amd64:3.1 Identify the policy rule violated. This can only be done via the Sysdig Secure UI. Add the Whitelist Rule The default Falco rules within Sysdig Secure are read-only. To modify a rule, rewrite it as a custom rule: From the Policies module, navigate to the Rules Editor tab. Define the macro by either creating a new macro, or editing an existing macro: This example edits an existing macro. The process is the same for creating a new macro, but requires a unique name. Find the existing macro in the Default Rules section, and copy it into the Custom Rules section Add a condition to the macro that defines the object to be whitelisted: Find the existing default rule, and determine if it uses the user_trusted containers macro: In this example, Write below root does not use the user_trusted_containers macro. Copy the rule to the Custom Rules section. Add the configured macro to the rule: Click the Save button to save the changes. The updated rule will be available the next time the Sysdig Agent checks into the back-end (usually every 10 seconds or so). Check Policy Events are Cleared Once the policy has been applied and the events are cleared from being notified, the whitelisted object should show either No events found , or with this policy no longer triggered: " },

"body" : "The Sysdig agent retrieves data from your Java virtual machines using the JMX protocol. The agent is configured to automatically discover active Java virtual machines and poll them for basic JVM metrics like Heap Memory and Garbage collector as well as application specific metrics for ActiveMQ, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, HBase, Kafka, Tomcat, and Zookeeper. The agent can also be easily configured to extract custom JMX metrics coming from your own Java processes. Metrics extracted are shown in the pre-defined Application views or under the Metrics > JVM and JMX menus. The default JMX metrics configuration is found in the \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.default.yaml file. When customizing existing entries, copy the complete application's bean listing from that defaults yaml file into the user settings file \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml . The Sysdig agent will merge configurations of both files. Here is what your dragent.yaml file might look like for a customized entry for the Spark application: customerid: 07c948-your-key-here-006f3b\ntags: local:nyc,service:db3\njmx:\n per_process_beans:\n spark: \n pattern: \"spark\"\n beans:\n - query: \"metrics:name=Spark shell.BlockManager.disk.diskSpaceUsed_MB\"\n attributes:\n - name: VALUE \n alias: spark.metric Include the jmx: and per_process_beans: section headers at the beginning of your application\/bean list. For more information on adding parameters to a container agent's configuration file, see Understanding the Agent Config Files . Contents Bean Configuration Limits Aliases Troubleshooting: Why Can't I See Java (JMX) Metrics? JMX Remote Java Versions Java-Based Applications and JMX Authentication Disabling JMX Polling Bean Configuration Basic JVM metrics are pre-defined inside the default_beans: section. This section is defined in the agent's default settings file and contains beans and attributes that are going to be polled for every Java process, like memory and garbage collector usage: jmx:\n default_beans:\n - query: \"java.lang:type=Memory\"\n attributes:\n - HeapMemoryUsage\n - NonHeapMemoryUsage\n - query: \"java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,*\"\n attributes:\n - name: \"CollectionCount\"\n type: \"counter\"\n - name: \"CollectionTime\"\n type: \"counter\" Metrics specific for each application are specified in sections named after the applications. For example, this is the Tomcat section: per_process_beans:\n tomcat:\n pattern: \"catalina\"\n beans:\n - query: \"Catalina:type=Cache,*\"\n attributes:\n - accessCount\n - cacheSize\n - hitsCount\n - . . . The key name, tomcat in this case, will be displayed as a process name in the Sysdig Monitor user interface instead of just java . The pattern: parameter specifies a string that is used to match a java process name and arguments with this set of JMX metrics. If the process main class full name contains the given text, the process is tagged and the metrics specified in the section will be fetched. The class names are matched against the process argument list. If you implement JMX metrics in a custom manner that does not expose the class names on the command line, you will need to find a pattern which conveniently matches your java invocation command line. The beans: section contains the list of beans to be queried, based on JMX patterns. JMX patterns are explained in details in the Oracle documentation , but in practice, the format of the query line is pretty simple: you can specify the full name of the bean like java.lang:type=Memory , or you can fetch multiple beans in a single line using the wildcard * as in: java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,* To get the list of all the beans that your application exports, you can use JVisualVM , Jmxterm , JConsole or other similar tools. Here is a screenshot from JConsole showing where to find the namespace, bean and attribute (metric) information (JConsole is available when you install the Java Development Kit): For each query, you can specify the attributes that you want to retrieve. We support the following JMX attributes (For these attributes, all the subattributes will be retrieved): Numeric CompositeDataSupport Attributes may be absolute values or rates. For values, we need to calculate a per second rate before sending them. In this case, you can specify type: counter , the default is rate which can be omitted, so usually you can simply write the attribute name. Limits The total number of JMX metrics polled per host is limited to 500. The maximum number of beans queried per process is limited to 300. If more metrics are needed please contact your sales representative with your use case. In agents 0.46 and earlier, the limit was 100 beans for each process. Aliases JMX beans and attributes can have very long names. To avoid interface cluttering we added support for aliasing, you can specify an alias in the attribute configuration. For example: cassandra:\n pattern: \"cassandra\"\n beans:\n - query: \"org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageProxy\n attributes:\n - name: RecentWriteLatencyMicros\n alias: cassandra.write.latency\n - name: RecentReadLatencyMicros\n alias: cassandra.read.latency In this way the alias will be used in Sysdig Monitor instead of the raw bean name. Aliases can be dynamic as well, getting data from the bean name - useful where you use pattern bean queries. For example: - query: \"java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,*\"\n attributes:\n - name: CollectionCount\n type: counter\n alias: jvm.gc.NAME.count\n - name: CollectionTime\n type: counter\n alias: jvm.gc.NAME.time This query will match multiple beans (All Garbage collectors) and the metric name will reflect the name of the Garbage Collector. For example: jvm.gc.ConcurrentMarkSweep.count . General syntax is: {<bean_property_key>} , to get all beans properties you can use a JMX explorer like JVisualVM or Jmxterm. Troubleshooting: Why Can't I See Java (JMX) Metrics? The Sysdig agent normally auto-discovers Java processes running on your host and enables the JMX extensions for polling them. JMX Remote If your Java application is not discovered automatically by the agent, try adding the following parameter on your application's command line: -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote For more information, see Oracle's web page on monitoring using JMX technology . Java Versions Only Java versions 7 and 8 are currently supported by the Sysdig agent. If you do not see JMX metrics reporting, your Java version may be older or newer. Java-Based Applications and JMX Authentication For Java-based applications (Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Tomcat, Zookeeper and etc.), the Sysdig agent requires the Java runtime environment (JRE) to be installed to poll for metrics (beans). The Sysdig agent does not support JMX authentication. If the Docker-container-based Sysdig agent is installed, the JRE is installed alongside the agent binaries and no further dependencies exist. However, if you are installing the service-based agent (non-container) and you do not see the JVM\/JMX metrics reporting, your host may not have the JRE installed or it may not be installed in the expected location: usr\/bin\/java To confirm if the Sysdig agent is able to find the JRE, restart the agent with service dragent restart and check the agent's \/opt\/draios\/logs\/draios.log file for the two Java detection and location log entries recorded during agent startup. Example if Java is missing or not found: \n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java detected: false\n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java_binary: Example if Java is found: \n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java detected: true\n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java_binary: \/usr\/bin\/java If Java is not installed, the resolution is to install the Java Runtime Environment . If your host has Java installed but not in the expected location ( \/usr\/bin\/java ) you can install a symlink from \/usr\/bin\/java to the actual binary OR set the java_home: variable in the Sysdig agent's configuration file: \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml java_home: \/usr\/my_java_location\/ Disabling JMX Polling If you do not need it or otherwise want to disable JMX metrics reporting, you can add the following two lines to the agent's user settings configuration file \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml : jmx:\n enabled: false After editing the file, restart the native Linux agent via service dragent restart or restart the container agent to make the change take effect. If using our containerized agent, instead of editing the dragent.yaml file, you can add this extra parameter in the docker run command when starting the agent: \n-e ADDITIONAL_CONF=\"jmx:\\n enabled: false\\n\" " },

Using a StatsD library specific to your application's language, it allows for the easy generation and transmission of custom application metrics to a collection server. The Sysdig agent contains an embedded StatsD server, so your custom metrics can now be sent to our collector and be relayed to the Sysdig Monitor backend for aggregation.

Configuring alert notifications is also exactly the same. Contents Installation and Configuration Sending StatsD Metrics Active Collection Passive Collection Supported Metric Types Counter Gauge Set Metric Labels Limits Compatible Clients Turning Off StatsD Reporting Changing the StatsD Listener Port and Transport Protocol Characters Allowed For StatsD Metric Names Installation and Configuration The Statsd server, embedded in Sysdig agent beginning with version 0.1.136, is pre-configured and starts by default so no additional user configuration is necessary. Install the agent in a supported distribution directly or install the Docker containerized version in your container server and you're done. Sending StatsD Metrics Active Collection By default, the Sysdig agent's embedded StatsD collector listens on the standard StatsD port, 8125 , both on TCP and UDP. StatsD is a text based protocol , where samples are separated by a \\n . Sending metrics from your application to the collector is as simple as: \necho \"hello_statsd:1|c\" > \/dev\/udp\/127.0.0.1\/8125 The example transmits the counter metric \"hello_statsd\" with a value of '1' to the Statsd collector listening on UDP port 8125. Here is a second example sending the output of a more complex shell command giving the number of established network connections: \necho \"EstablishedConnections:`netstat -a | grep ESTAB | wc -l`|c\" > \/dev\/udp\/127.0.0.1\/8125 The protocol format is as follows: \nMETRIC_NAME:METRIC_VALUE|TYPE[|@SAMPLING_RATIO] Metric names can be any string except reserved characters: |#:@ . Value is a number and depends on the metric type. Type can be any of: c , ms , g , s . Sampling ratio is a value between 0 (exclusive) and 1 and it's used to handle subsampling. When sent, metrics will be available in the same display menu for the subviews as the built in metrics. Passive Collection In infrastructures already containing a third party StatsD collection server, StatsD metrics can be collected \"out of band\". A passive collection technique is automatically performed by our agent by intercepting system calls - as is done for all the Sysdig Monitor metrics normally collected. This method does not require changing your current StatsD configuration and is an excellent way to 'test drive' the Sysdig Monitor application without having to perform any modifications other than agent installation. The passive mode of collection is especially suitable for containerized environments where simplicity and efficiency are essential. With the containerized version of the Sysdig Monitor agent running on the host, all other container applications can continue to transmit to any currently implemented collector. In the case where no collector exists, container applications can simply be configured to send StatsD metrics to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1) as demonstrated above - no actual StatsD server needs to be listening at that address. Effectively, each network transmission made from inside the application container, including statsd messages sent to a non existent destination, generates a system call. The Sysdig agent captures these system calls from its own container, where the statsd collector is listening. In practice, the Sysdig agent acts as a transparent proxy between the application and the StatsD collector, even if they are in different containers. The agent correlates which container a system call is coming from, and uses that information to transparently label the StatsD messages. The above graphic demonstrates the components of the Sysdig agent and where metrics are actively or passively collected. Regardless of the method of collection, the number of StatsD metrics the agent can transmit is limited by your payment plan. Note 1 : When using the passive technique, ICMP port unreachable events may be generated on the host network. Note 2: Some clients may use IPv6 addressing (::1) for the \"localhost\" address string. Metrics collection over IPv6 is not supported at this time. If your StatsD metrics are not visible in the Sysdig Monitor interface, please use \"127.0.0.1\" instead of \"localhost\" string to force IPv4. Another solution that may be required is adding the JVM option: java.net .preferIPv4Stack=true. Note 3 : When StatsD metrics are not continuously transmitted by your application (once per second as in the case of all agent created metrics), the charts will render a 'zero' or null value. Any alert conditions will only look at those Statsd values actually transmitted and ignore the nulls. For more detail on the benefits of Sysdig Monitor's implementation of StatsD, please see the article State of the Art: StatsD Deployment Strategies in Containerized Environments . Supported Metric Types Counter A counter metric is updated with the value sent by the application, sent to the Sysdig Monitor backend, and then reset to zero. You can use it to count, for example, how many calls have been made to an API: api.login:1|c You can specify negative values to decrement a counter. Gauge A gauge is a single value that will be sent as is: table_size:10000|g These are plotted as received, in the sense, they are at a point in time metrics. You can achieve relative increments or decrements on a counter by prepending the value with a + or a - respectively. As an example, these three samples will cause table_size to be 950: table_size:1000|g\ntable_size:-100|g\ntable_size:+50|g In Sysdig Monitor, the gauge value is only rendered on the various charts when it is actually transmitted by your application. When not transmitted, a null is plotted on the charts which is not used in any calculations or alerts. Set A set is like a counter, but it counts unique elements. For example: \nactive_users:user1|s active_users:user2|sactive_users:user1|s Will cause the value of active_users to be 2. Metric Labels Labels are an extension of the StatsD specification offered by Sysdig Monitor to offer better flexibility in the way metrics are grouped, filtered and visualized. Labeling can be achieved by using the following syntax: enqueued_messages#users,country=italy:10|c In general, this is the syntax you can use for labeling: \nMETRIC_NAME#LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE,LABEL_NAME ... Labels can be simple strings or key\/value pairs, separated by an = sign. Simple labels can be used for filtering in the Sysdig Monitor web interface. Key\/value labels can be used for both filtering and segmentation. Label names prefixed with 'agent.label' are reserved for Sysdig agent use only and any custom labels starting with that prefix will be ignored. Limits The number of StatsD metrics the agent can transmit is limited to 100 for the host and 100 for all running containers combined. If more metrics are needed please contact your sales representative with your use case. Compatible Clients Every StatsD compliant client works with our implementation. Here is a quick list, it's provided just as reference. We don't support them, we support only the protocol specification compliance. Node.js Java Python PHP Ruby Go A full list can be found at the StatsD GitHub page . Turning Off StatsD Reporting To disable Sysdig agent's embedded StatsD server, append the following lines to the \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml configuration file in each installed host: statsd:\n enabled: false After modifying the configuration file, you will need to restart the agent with: service dragent restart Changing the StatsD Listener Port and Transport Protocol To modify the port that the agent's embedded StatsD server listens on, append the following lines to the \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml configuration file in each installed host (replace #### with your port): statsd:\n tcp_port: ####\n udp_port: #### Characters Allowed For StatsD Metric Names Use standard ASCII characters, we suggest also to use . namespaces as we do for all our metrics.

"body" : " Introduction Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments Summary of Functionality Configuration Main Config Parameters Process Filter conf Authentication Integration conf Authentication Example Kubernetes Objects Examples Histograms Logging Troubleshooting Legacy Prometheus Application Check Introduction Starting with version 0.70.0, the Sysdig Monitor Agent provides rich support for automatically scraping metrics from Prometheus exporters . This article describes default behaviors and how to further configure the feature to specify which processes and ports should be targeted for scraping. See our blog post for additional context on the Prometheus metric format and how such metrics are typically used. The Sysdig Monitor Agent also had rudimentary Prometheus support in versions older than 0.70.0. If you were using this functionality, see the section below on the Legacy Prometheus Application Check for important upgrade information. Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments Prometheus users who are already leveraging Kubernetes Service Discovery (specifically the approach in this sample prometheus-kubernetes.yml ) may already have Annotations attached to their Pods that mark them as eligible for scraping. Such environments can quickly begin scraping the same metrics using the Sysdig Agent in a couple easy steps. Enable the Prometheus metrics feature in the Sysdig Agent. Assuming you are deploying using DaemonSets , the needed config can be added to the Agent's dragent.yaml by including the following in your DaemonSet YAML (placing it in the env section for the sysdig-agent container): - name: ADDITIONAL_CONF\n value: \"prometheus:\\n enabled: true\"\n\n Ensure the Kubernetes Pods that contain your Prometheus exporters have been deployed with the following Annotations to enable scraping (substituting the listening exporter-TCP-port) : spec:\n template:\n metadata:\n annotations:\n prometheus.io\/scrape: \"true\"\n prometheus.io\/port: \"exporter-TCP-port\" The configuration above assumes your exporters use the typical endpoint called \/metrics . If an exporter is using a different endpoint, this can also be specified by adding the following additional optional Annotation, substituting the exporter-endpoint-name : \nprometheus.io\/path: \"\/exporter-endpoint-name\" If you try this Kubernetes Deployment of a simple exporter , you will quickly see auto-discovered Prometheus metrics being displayed in Sysdig Monitor. You can use this working example as a basis to similarly Annotate your own exporters. If you have Prometheus exporters not deployed in annotated Kubernetes Pods that you would like to scrape, the following sections describe the full set of options to configure the Agent to find and scrape your metrics. Summary of Functionality The Sysdig Monitor Agent uses its visibility to all running processes (at both the host and container levels) to find eligible targets for scraping Prometheus metrics. By default, no scraping is attempted. Once the feature is enabled, the Agent assembles a list of eligible targets in two steps: A process is determined to be eligible for possible scraping if it positively matches against a series of Process Filter include\/exclude rules. The Agent will then attempt to scrape an eligible process at a \/metrics endpoint on all of its listening TCP ports, unless additional configuration is present to restrict scraping to a subset of ports and\/or another endpoint name. The metrics ultimately appear in the Sysdig Monitor Explore interface in the Prometheus section. Within the set of eligible processes\/ports\/endpoints, the Agent uses an auto-discover approach to scrape only ports that are exporting Prometheus metrics, and will stop attempting to scrape or retry on ports based on how they respond to attempts to connect and scrape them. It is therefore strongly recommended that you create a configuration that restricts the process and ports for attempted scraping to the minimum expected range for your exporters. This minimizes the potential for unintended side-effects in both the Agent and your applications due to repeated failed connection attempts. Configuration As is typical for the Agent, the default configuration for the feature is specified in dragent.default.yaml , and you can override the defaults by configuring parameters in the dragent.yaml . For each parameter you do not set in dragent.yaml , the defaults in dragent.default.yaml will remain in effect. Main Config Parameters Parameter Default Description enabled false Turns Prometheus scraping on\/off. interval 10 How often (in seconds) the Agent will scrape a port for Prometheus metrics log_errors true Whether the Agent should log details on failed attempts to scrape eligible targets max_metrics 1000 The maximum number of total Prometheus metrics that will be scraped across all targets. This value of 1000 is the maximum per-Agent, and is a separate limit from other Custom Metrics (e.g. statsd , JMX , and other Application Checks ). Integrate Applications (Default App Checks) max_metrics_per_process 100 The maximum number of Prometheus metrics that the Agent will save from a single scraped target max_tags_per_metric 20 The maximum number of tags per Prometheus metric that the Agent will save from a scraped target histograms false Whether the Agent should scrape and report histogram metrics. See the section below on histograms for details. process_filter See below Specifies which processes may be eligible for scraping. See the Process Filter section below. Process Filter The process_filter section specifies which of the processes known by an Agent may be eligible for scraping. Note that once you specify a process_filter in your dragent.yaml , this replaces the entire Prometheus process_filter section (i.e. all rules) shown in the dragent.default.yaml . The Process Filter is specified in a series of include and exclude rules that are evaluated top-to-bottom for each process known by an Agent. If a process matches an include rule, scraping will be attempted via a \/metrics endpoint on each listening TCP port for the process, unless a conf section also appears within the rule to further restrict how the process will be scraped (see the \"conf\" section below). Multiple patterns can be specified in a single rule, in which case all patterns must match for the rule to be a match (AND logic). Within a pattern value, simple \"glob\" wildcarding may be used, where * matches any number of characters (including none) and ? matches any single character. Note that due to YAML syntax, when using wildcards, be sure to enclose the value in quotes ( \"*\" ). The table below describes the supported patterns in Process Filter rules. To provide realistic examples, we'll use a simple sample Prometheus exporter (source code here ) which can be deployed as a container using the Docker command line below. To help illustrate some of the configuration options, this sample exporter presents Prometheus metrics on \/promtheus instead of the more common \/metrics endpoint, which will be shown in the example configurations further below. # docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \\\n --label class=\"exporter\" \\\n --name my-java-app \\\n luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n \n# ps auxww | grep app.jar\nroot 11502 95.9 9.2 3745724 753632 ? Ssl 15:52 1:42 java -jar \/app.jar --management.security.enabled=false\n \n# curl http:\/\/localhost:8080\/prometheus\n...\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.005\",} 6.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.01\",} 17.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.025\",} 51.0\n... Pattern name Description Example container.image Matches if the process is running inside a container running the specified image - include: container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app container.name Matches if the process is running inside a container with the specified name - include: container.name: my-java-app container.label.* Matches if the process is running in a container that has a Label matching the given value - include: container.label.class: exporter kubernetes.<object>.annotation.* kubernetes.<object>.label.* Matches if the process is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with the Annotation\/Label matching the given value. Note: This pattern does not apply to the Docker-only command-line shown above, but would instead apply if the exporter were installed as a Kubernetes Deployment using this example YAML . Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. - include: kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: true process.name Matches the name of the running process - include: process.name: java process.cmdline Matches a command line argument - include: process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\" port Matches if the process is listening on one or more TCP ports. The pattern for a single rule can specify a single port as shown in this example, or a single range (e.g. 8079-8081 ), but does not support comma-separated lists of ports\/ranges. Note: This parameter is only used to confirm if a process is eligible for scraping based on the ports on which it is listening. For example, if a process is listening on one port for application traffic and has a second port open for exporting Prometheus metrics, it would be possible to specify the application port here (but not the exporting port), and the exporting port in the conf section (but not the application port), and the process would be matched as eligible and the exporting port would be scraped. - include: port: 8080 appcheck.match Matches if an Application Check with the specific name or pattern is scheduled to run for the process. Integrate Applications (Default App Checks) - exclude: appcheck.match: \"*\" Instead of the include examples shown above that would have each matched our process, due to the previously-described ability to combine multiple patterns in a single rule, the following very strict configuration would also have matched: - include:\n container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n container.name: my-java-app\n container.label.class: exporter\n process.name: java\n process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\"\n port: 8080 conf Each include rule in the port_filter may include a conf portion that further describes how scraping will be attempted on the eligible process. If a conf portion is not included, scraping will be attempted at a \/metrics endpoint on all listening ports of the matching process. The possible settings: Parameter name Description Example port Either a static number for a single TCP port to be scraped, or a container\/Kubernetes Label name or Kubernetes Annotation specified in curly braces. If the process is running in a container that is marked with this Label or is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with this Annotation\/Label, scraping will be attempted only on the port specified as the value of the Label\/Annotation. Note: The Label\/Annotation to match against will not include the text shown in red . Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. Note: If running the exporter inside a container, this should specify the port number that the exporter process in the container is listening on, not the port that the container exposes to the host. port: 8080 - or - port: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.port}\" - or - port: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/port}\" port_filter A set of include and exclude rules that define the ultimate set of listening TCP ports for an eligible process on which scraping may be attempted. Note that the syntax is different from the port pattern option from within the higher-level include rule in the process_filter . Here a given rule can include single ports, comma-separated lists of ports (enclosed in square brackets), or contiguous port ranges (without brackets). port_filter: - include: 8080 - exclude: [9092,9200,9300] - include: 9090-9100 path Either the static specification of an endpoint to be scraped, or a container\/Kubernetes Label name or Kubernetes Annotation specified in curly braces. If the process is running in a container that is marked with this Label or is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with this Annotation\/Label, scraping will be attempted via the endpoint specified as the value of the Label\/Annotation. If path is not specified, or specified but the Agent does not find the Label\/Annotation attached to the process, the common Prometheus exporter default of \/metrics will be used. Note: A Label\/Annotation to match against will not include the text shown in red . Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. path: \"\/prometheus\" - or - path: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.path}\" - or - path: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/path}\" host A hostname or IP address. The default is localhost. host: 192.168.1.101\n- or -\nhost: subdomain.example.com\n- or -\nhost: localhost use_https When set to true , connectivity to the exporter will only be attempted through HTTPS instead of HTTP. It is false by default. (Available in Agent version 0.79.0 and newer) use_https: true ssl_verify When set to true , verification will be performed for the server certificates for an HTTPS connection. It is false by default. Verification was enabled by default before 0.79.0. (Available in Agent version 0.79.0 and newer) ssl_verify: true Authentication Integration As of agent version 0.89, Sysdig can collect Prometheus metrics from endpoints requiring authentication. Use the parameters below to enable this function. For username\/password authentication: username password For authentication using a token: auth_token_path For certificate authentication with a certificate key: auth_cert_path auth_key_path Token substitution is also supported for all the authorization parameters. For instance a username can be taken from a Kubernetes annotation by specifying username: \"{ kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/username }\" conf Authentication Example Below is an example of the dragent.yaml section showing all the Prometheus authentication configuration options, on OpenShift, Kubernetes, and etcd. In this example: The username\/password are taken from a default annotation used by OpenShift. The auth token path is commonly available in Kubernetes deployments. The certificate and key used here for etcd may normally not be as easily accessible to the agent. In this case they were extracted from the host namespace, constructed into Kubernetes secrets, and then mounted into the agent container. prometheus: \n enabled: true\n process_filter: \n - include: \n port: 1936\n conf: \n username: \"{kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/username}\"\n password: \"{kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/password}\"\n - include: \n process.name: kubelet\n conf: \n port: 10250\n use_https: true\n auth_token_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/kubernetes.io\/serviceaccount\/token\"\n - include: \n process.name: etcd\n conf: \n port: 2379\n use_https: true\n auth_cert_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/etcd\/client-cert\"\n auth_key_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/etcd\/client-key\" Kubernetes Objects As described above, there are multiple configuration options that can be set based on auto-discovered values for Kubernetes Labels and\/or Annotations. The format in each case begins with \"kubernetes.OBJECT.annotation.\" or \"kubernetes.OBJECT.label.\" where OBJECT can be any of the following supported Kubernetes object types: daemonSet deployment namespace node pod replicaSet replicationController service statefulset The configuration text you add after the final dot becomes the name of the Kubernetes Label\/Annotation that the Agent will look for. If the Label\/Annotation is discovered attached to the process, the value of that Label\/Annotation will be used for the configuration option. Note that there are multiple ways for a Kubernetes Label\/Annotation to be attached to a particular process. One of the simplest examples of this is the Pod-based approach shown above in the Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments . However, as an example alternative to marking at the Pod level, you could attach Labels\/Annotations at the Namespace level, in which case auto-discovered configuration options would apply to all processes running in that Namespace regardless of whether they're in a Deployment, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, etc. Examples As an example that pulls together many of the configuration elements shown above, consider the default Agent configuration that's inherited from the dragent.default.yaml . prometheus:\n enabled: false\n interval: 10\n log_errors: true\n max_metrics: 1000\n max_metrics_per_process: 100\n max_tags_per_metric: 20\n \n # Filtering processes to scan. Processes not matching a rule will not\n # be scanned\n # If an include rule doesn't contain a port or port_filter in the conf\n # section, we will scan all the ports that a matching process is listening to.\n process_filter:\n - exclude:\n process.name: docker-proxy\n - exclude:\n container.image: sysdig\/agent\n # special rule to exclude processes matching configured prometheus appcheck\n - exclude:\n appcheck.match: prometheus\n - include:\n container.label.io.prometheus.scrape: \"true\"\n conf:\n # Custom path definition\n # If the Label doesn't exist we'll still use \"\/metrics\"\n path: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.path}\"\n \n # Port definition\n # - If the Label exists, only scan the given port.\n # - If it doesn't, use port_filter instead.\n # - If there is no port_filter defined, skip this process\n port: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.port}\"\n port_filter:\n - exclude: [9092,9200,9300]\n - include: 9090-9500\n - include: [9913,9984,24231,42004]\n - exclude:\n container.label.io.prometheus.scrape: \"false\"\n - include:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: true\n conf:\n path: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/path}\"\n port: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/port}\"\n - exclude:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: false Things to note about this default configuration: Once enabled, this default configuration is ideal for the use case described above in the Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments . All Prometheus scraping is disabled by default to allow for a smooth transition for users of the legacy Prometheus Application Check (see the note below ). To enable the entire config shown here, you would only need to add the following to your dragent.yaml : prometheus:\n enabled: true A Process Filter rule excludes processes that are likely to exist in most environments but are known to never export Prometheus metrics, such as the Docker Proxy and the Agent itself. Another Process Filter rule ensures that any processes configured to be scraped by the legacy Prometheus Application Check will not be scraped. See the section below on the Legacy Prometheus Application Check for details. Another Process Filter rule is tailored to use of container Labels. Processes marked with the container Label io.prometheus.scrape will become eligible for scraping, and if further marked with container Labels io.prometheus.port and\/or io.prometheus.path , scraping will be attempted only on this port and\/or endpoint. If the container is not marked with the specified path Label, scraping the \/metrics endpoint will be attempted. If the container is not marked with the specified port Label, any listening ports in the port_filter will be attempted for scraping (this port_filter in the default is set for the range of ports for common Prometheus exporters , with exclusions for ports in the range that are known to be used by other applications that are not exporters). The final Process Filter include rule is tailored to the use case described above in Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments . With this default configuration enabled, a containerized install of our example exporter shown below would be automatically scraped via the Agent. # docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \\\n --label io.prometheus.scrape=\"true\" \\\n --label io.prometheus.port=\"8080\" \\\n --label io.prometheus.path=\"\/prometheus\" \\\n luca3m\/prometheus-java-app Similarly, in a Kubernetes-based environment, a Deployment with the Annotations as shown in using this example YAML would also be scraped by enabling the default configuration. apiVersion: extensions\/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n name: prometheus-java-app\nspec:\n replicas: 1\n template:\n metadata:\n labels:\n app: prometheus-java-app\n annotations:\n prometheus.io\/scrape: \"true\"\n prometheus.io\/path: \"\/prometheus\"\n prometheus.io\/port: \"8080\"\n spec:\n containers:\n - name: prometheus-java-app\n image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n imagePullPolicy: Always\n\n Finally, we'll consider an example for a non-containerized environment or a containerized environment that doesn't use Labels or Annotations. The following dragent.yaml would override the default and do per-second scrapes of our sample exporter and also a second exporter on port 5005, each at their respective non-standard endpoints. This can be thought of as a conservative \"whitelist\" type of configuration since it restricts scraping to only exporters that are known to exist in the environment and the ports on which they're known to export Prometheus metrics. prometheus:\n enabled: true\n interval: 1\n process_filter:\n - include:\n process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\"\n conf:\n port: 8080\n path: \"\/prometheus\"\n - include:\n port: 5005\n conf:\n port: 5005\n path: \"\/wacko\" Histograms By default, the Agent does not scrape details for the histogram metrics reported by exporters. To enable this, include the additional histograms option: prometheus:\n enabled: true\n histograms: true Note that the way Prometheus histograms are typically reported by exporters, they are cumulative across buckets and also report accumulations within each bucket range since the exporter started. To make this data easier to visualize, the Sysdig Monitor application presents histogram data as a delta over the selected time range. For instance, below we've had our sample Prometheus exporter running for over an hour, accumulating data in a histogram metric called random: # curl http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8080\/prometheus\n...\n# HELP random Random sleep\n# TYPE random histogram\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.005\",} 33.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.01\",} 74.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.025\",} 180.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.05\",} 404.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.075\",} 639.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.1\",} 848.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.25\",} 2145.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.5\",} 4307.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.75\",} 6371.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"1.0\",} 8592.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"2.5\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"5.0\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"7.5\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"10.0\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"+Inf\",} 8619.0\n... However in the Sysdig Monitor interface, if we select the metric and a time range such as 10 minutes, we'll see the per-bucket distribution for only that time range. Hover your mouse over a particular bar to see the bucket range. If this histogram metric is being reported from multiple sources, you will see the contribution to the total from each source based on your choice of Segment by . In this case we are segmenting by hostname and only have one contributing source, called \"ubuntu16\". Logging After the Agent begins scraping Prometheus metrics, there may be a delay of up to a few minutes before the metrics become visible in Sysdig Monitor. To help quickly confirm your configuration is correct, starting with Agent version 0.80.0, the following log line will appear in the Agent log the first time since since starting that it has found and is successfully scraping at least one Prometheus exporter: \n2018-05-04 21:42:10.048, 8820, Information, 05-04 21:42:10.048324 Starting export of Prometheus metrics As this is an INFO level log message, it will appear in Agents using the default logging settings. To reveal even more detail, increase the Agent log level to DEBUG , which produces a message like the following that reveals the name of a specific metric first detected. You can then look for this metric to be visible in Sysdig Monitor shortly after. \n2018-05-04 21:50:46.068, 11212, Debug, 05-04 21:50:46.068141 First prometheus metrics since agent start: pid 9583: 5 metrics including: randomSummary.95percentile Troubleshooting See the previous section for information on expected log messages during successful scraping. If you have enabled Prometheus and are not seeing the Starting export message shown there, revisit your configuration. It is also suggested to leave the configuration option in its default setting of log_errors: true , which will reveal any issues scraping eligible processes in the Agent log. For example, here is an error message for a failed scrape of a TCP port that was listening but not accepting HTTP requests: \n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks[4987] Exception on running check prometheus.5000: Exception('Timeout when hitting http:\/\/localhost:5000\/metrics',)\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, Traceback (most recent call last):\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, File \"\/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/sdchecks.py\", line 246, in run\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, self.check_instance.check(self.instance_conf)\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, File \"\/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/checks.d\/prometheus.py\", line 44, in check\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, metrics = self.get_prometheus_metrics(query_url, timeout, \"prometheus\")\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, File \"\/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/checks.d\/prometheus.py\", line 105, in get_prometheus_metrics\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.077, 4984, Error, sdchecks, raise Exception(\"Timeout when hitting %s\" % url)\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.077, 4984, Error, sdchecks, Exception: Timeout when hitting http:\/\/localhost:5000\/metrics Here is an example error message for a failed scrape of a port that was responding to HTTP requests on the \/metrics endpoint but not responding with valid Prometheus-format data. The invalid endpoint is responding as follows: # curl http:\/\/localhost:5002\/metrics\nThis ain't no Prometheus metrics! And the corresponding error message in the Agent log, indicating no further scraping will be attempted after the initial failure: \n2017-10-13 22:03:05.081, 5216, Information, sdchecks[5219] Skip retries for Prometheus error: could not convert string to float: ain't\n2017-10-13 22:03:05.082, 5216, Error, sdchecks[5219] Exception on running check prometheus.5002: could not convert string to float: ain't Legacy Prometheus Application Check Special care should be taken if you're already using the legacy Prometheus Application Check (explained below) to scrape any Prometheus metrics. You will be able to scrape for the same metrics using the new approach and they will appear in Sysdig Monitor under the same metric name. However, any historical data from when it was collected via the legacy Prometheus App Check will no longer be visible. As a result, the new approach is disabled by default, and you should carefully plan your transition to using the new approach for each set of metrics when you feel you can endure the break with historical data. The legacy Prometheus application check is able to collect metrics from a static external HTTP endpoint exposing metrics in Prometheus format and import them as StatsD metrics in Sysdig. To configure the legacy Prometheus application check, Add these lines to the agent's configuration file: app_checks:\n - name: prometheus\n pattern:\n comm: python\n arg: \/opt\/draios\/bin\/sdchecks\n conf:\n url: http:\/\/{YOUR_PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_IP}:8080\/metrics " },

"body" : "You can search for particular strings within a given log file, and create a metric that is displayed in Sysdig Monitor's Explore page. The metrics appear under the StatsD section: Sysdig provides this functionality via a \"chisel\" script called \"logwatcher\", written in Lua. You call the script by adding a logwatcher parameter in the chisels section of the agent configuration file ( dragent.yaml ). You define the log file name and the precise string to be searched. The results are displayed as metrics in the Monitor UI. Caveats Implementation Preparation Edit dragent.yaml Parameters View Log File Metrics in the Monitor UI Caveats The logwatcher chisel adds to Sysdig's monitoring capability but is not a fully featured log monitor. Note the following limitations: No regex support: Sysdig does not offer regex support; you must define the precise log file and string to be searched. (If you were to supply a string with spaces, forward-slashes, or back-slashes in it, the metric generated would also have these characters and so could not be used to create an alert.) Limit of 12 string searches\/host: Logwatcher is implemented as a LUA script and, due to resources consumed by this chisel, it is not recommended to have more than a dozen string searches configured per agent\/host. Implementation Edit the agent configuration file to enable the logwatcher chisel. See Understanding the Agent Config Files for editing options. Preparation Determine the log file name(s) and string(s) you want to monitor. To monitor the output of docker logs <container-name>, find the container's docker log file with: docker inspect <container-name> | grep LogPath Edit dragent.yaml Access dragent.yaml directly at \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml . Add a chisels entry: Format: chisels:\n - name: logwatcher\n args:\n filespattern: YOURFILENAME.log\n term: YOURSTRING Sample Entry: customerid: 831f2-your-key-here-d69401\ntags: tagname.tagvalue\nchisels:\n - name: logwatcher\n args:\n filespattern: draios.log\n term: Sent In this example, Sysdig's own draios.log is searched for the Sent string. The output, in the Sysdig Monitor UI, would show the StatsD metric logwatcher.draios_log.Sent and the number of 'Sent' items detected. Optional: Add multiple -name: sections in the config file to search for additional logs\/strings. Note the recommended 12-string\/agent limit. Restart the agent for changes to take effect. For container agent: docker restart sysdig-agent For non-containerized (service) agent: service dragent restart Parameters Name Value Description name logwatcher The chisel used in the enterprise Sysdig platform to search log files. (Other chisels are available in Sysdig's open-source product.) filespattern YOURFILENAME.log The log file to be searched. Do not specify a path with the file name. term YOURSTRING The string to be searched. View Log File Metrics in the Monitor UI To view logwatcher results: Log in to Sysdig Monitor and select Explore . Select Entire Infrastructure > Overview by Host. In the resulting drop-down, either scroll to Metrics > StatsD > logwatcher or enter \" logwatcher \" in the search field. Each string you configured in the agent config file will be listed in the format logwatcher.YOURFILENAME_log.STRING. The relevant metrics are displayed. You can also create an alert on logwatcher metrics, to be notified when an important log entry appears. " }
