"body" : "With the Kubernetes Policy Advisor, Sysdig Secure auto-generates Pod Security Policies (PSPs) to significantly decrease the time spent configuring Kubernetes Policies. Strict security policies reduce risk, but can also break applications. Sysdig tests the impact of pod security policies through simulations, enabling teams to adjust misconfigurations before shifting to production. There are three main features that comprise the Kubernetes Policy Advisor: Auto generation: Sysdig Secure can parse any Kubernetes yaml file that includes a pod spec to generate a tailor-made PSP based on the configuration. Simulations: Start a simulation of the auto-generated PSP or any user-inputted PSP to see what pods would have been blocked from running if this PSP had been actively applied to the cluster. Events and tuning: Each pod\/activity that would have violated the PSP will generate an event. Within the event details, users can see information about potential modifications they may need to make to the policy or the pod configuration. " },

Fixed issue preventing kernel module creation for Debian Buster This change adds support for building the Sysdig Monitor agent kernel module for Debian Buster. Improved event timestamp in Kubernetes This fix ensures that user events get the correct timestamp with Kubernetes v1.16 when the go_k8s_user_events option is set to true . Updated Kubernetes API used, in order to expand support of Kubernetes v1.16 In dragent.yaml , the Kubernetes API extensions\/v1beta1 is updated to apps\/v1 . This enables agent support for Kubernetes v1.16 even when the new_k8s option is set to false . Fixed a Kubernetes event reporting issue Fixed an issue with Kubernetes Events where the host MAC scope was not populated correctly, resulting in not showing up on the dashboard.

Fix for Kubernetes delegation error Fixed an issue that caused Kubernetes delegation to not work after the cointerface process restarts following a crash. Fix for accounting Network errors Network-related errors are now correctly accounted for instead of being treated as file-open errors. New Prometheus Client Version Updated  prometheus_client  to version 0.7.1. This should result in improved performance while ingesting Prometheus metrics. Fix for dropping StatsD Metrics A defect in earlier versions of Sysdig Monitor with the statsd.use_forwarder option could drop some StatsD metrics from containers. This change resolves that problem; the agent will begin fetching metrics from containers 10 seconds after first identifying that the container exists. The 10 second delay allows containers to start StatsD servers within their network namespaces if they choose. The timeout can be overridden using the statsd.container_server_creation_delay_s option, which specifies the delay in seconds. Fixed resource metrics for CRI-O containers The following metrics reporting correctly in the Monitor UI:  memory.limit.bytes, memory.limit.used.percent, and  cpu.quota.used.percent.

Kubernetes Namespace Overview : Provides a high-level summary of availability, and resource allocation and utilization across all the Workloads in the selected Namespace. Kubernetes Deployment Overview : Provides a detailed summary of pod status, pod restarts, as well as resource allocation and utilization across pods for each Workload. Kubernetes StatefulSet Overview : Provides a detailed summary of pod status, pod restarts, as well as resource allocation and utilization across pods for each StatefulSet. Kubernetes DaemonSet Overview : Provides a detailed summary of pod status, pod restarts, as well as resource allocation and utilization across pods. Kubernetes Job Overview : Provides a detailed summary of job status, completion trend, pod restarts, as well as resource allocation and utilization across pods. Kubernetes ReplicaSet Overview : Provides a detailed summary of pod status, pod restarts, as well as resource allocation and utilization across pods for each ReplicaSet. Kubernetes Pod Overview : Provides a detailed summary of pod status, pod restarts, and resource allocation and utilization in a selected pod. Kubernetes Workloads CPU Usage and Allocation : Helps you verify that CPU requests are properly configured and actual utilization is expected. Kubernetes Workloads Memory Usage and Allocation : Helps you verify that memory requests are properly configured and actual utilization is expected. Kubernetes CPU Allocation Optimization : Helps you verify that infrastructure resources are available for future needs and are not wasted. Kubernetes Memory Allocation Optimization : Helps you verify that infrastructure resources are available for future needs and are not wasted. The following Dashboards are retained: Health Overview (applicable to all the objects in the environment) Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (the default Dashboard when selecting an HPA) Resource Quota Service Health (the default dashboard when selecting a service) Cluster and Node Capacity The following Dashboards are removed: State Overview Daemonset State Namespace State Stateful State Nodes State Deployment State Deployment Health Nodes Health Namespace Health Pod State Pod Health Replica Set Health For more information, see .

Strict security policies reduce risk, but can also break applications. Sysdig tests the impact of pod security policies through simulations, enabling teams to adjust misconfigurations before shifting to production. There are three main features that comprise the Kubernetes Policy Advisor: Auto generation: Sysdig Secure can parse any Kubernetes yaml file that includes a pod spec to generate a tailor-made PSP based on the configuration. Simulations: Start a simulation of the auto-generated PSP or any user-inputted PSP to see what pods would have been blocked from running if this PSP had been actively applied to the cluster. Events and tuning: Each pod\/activity that would have violated the PSP will generate an event. Within the event details, users can see information about potential modifications they may need to make to the policy or the pod configuration. " },

"body" : "This topic gives insight into the metrics displayed on the Workloads Overview page. Pod Restarts The chart displays the latest value returned by sum(timeAvg(kubernetes.pod.restart.rate)) . What Is It? The sparkline shows the trend of Pod Restarts rate across all the pods in a selected Workload. The number shows the most recent rate, expressed in Restarts per Second. For instance, the image below shows the trend for the last hour. The number indicates that the rate of pod restarts is less than 0.01 for the last 10 minutes. For reference, the sparklines show the following number of steps (sampling): Last hour : 6 steps, each for a 10-minute time slice. Last 6 hours : 12 steps, each for a 20-minute time slice. Last day : 12 steps, each for a 2-hour time slice. What to Expect? A healthy pod will have 0 restarts at any given time. What to Do Otherwise? In most cases, fewer restarts in the last hour (or larger time windows) do not indicate a serious problem. Drill down to the Kubernetes Overview Dashboard related to the Workload in Explore . For example, Kubernetes StatefulSet Overview provides a detailed trend broken down by pods. In this example, the number of restarts is constant (roughly every 5 minutes) and no pods are ready. This might indicate a crash loop back-off . Pods Available vs Desired The chart shows the latest value of returned by sum(avg(kubernetes.deployment.replicas.available)) \/ sum(avg(kubernetes.deployment.replicas.desired)) . What Is It? The chart displays the ratio between available and desired pods, averaged across the selected time window, for all the pods in a given Workload. The upper bound shows the number of desired pods in the Workload. For instance, the image below shows all the 42 desired pods are available. What to Expect? You should typically expect 100%. If certain pods take a significant amount of time to become available (image pull time, pod initialization, readiness probe), then you may temporarily see a ratio lower than 100%. What to Do Otherwise? Determine the Workloads that have low availability by drilling down to the related Dashboard in Explore . For example, the Kubernetes Deployment Overview helps understand the trend and the state of the pods. For instance, the image above shows that the ratio is 98% (3.93 \/ 4 x 100). The slight decline is due to an update that caused pods to be terminated and consequently to be started with a newer version. CPU Used vs Requests The chart shows the latest value returned by sum(avg(cpu.cores.used)) \/ sum(avg(kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.cpuCores)) . Memory Used vs Requests The chart shows the latest value returned by sum(avg(memory.bytes.used)) \/ sum(avg(kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memBytes)) . What Is It? The chart shows the ratio between the total memory usage across all the pods in a Workload and the total memory requested by the Workload. The upper bound shows the total memory requested by all the pods, expressed in the specified unit of bytes. For instance, the image shows that the pods in the selected Workload requested for 120 GiB, of which 24% is actually used (about 29 GiB). What to Expect? The type of Workload determines the ratio. Values between 80% and 120% are considered normal. Values that are higher than 100% is deemed normal if it's observed only for a relatively short time. What to Do Otherwise? A low memory usage indicates that the application is not properly running (not executing the expected functions) or the Workload configuration is not accurate (requests are too high compared to what the pods actually need). A high memory usage indicates that the load is higher for applications or the Workload configuration is not accurate (low requests compared to what the pods actually need). Given the configured limits for the Workloads and the memory pressure on the nodes, if the Workloads use more memory than what’s requested they are at risk of eviction. For more information, see Container's Memory Limit . In either case, drill down to the Workloads page to determine the Workload that requires a deeper analysis. Can the Value Be Higher than 100%? Yes, it can. Configuring memory requests without limits or requests lower than limits is permissible. In these cases, you are allowing the containers to use more resources than requested, typically to handle temporary overloads. Consider a Workload with two containers. Say, one container is configured to request for 1 GiB of memory and uses 1 GiB (Used vs Request ratio is 100%), while the other is configured without any request and uses 1 GiB of memory. In this example, the 2 GiB of memory used to 1 GiB requested ratio is 200% at the Workload level. What Does “No Data” Mean? If the Workload is configured with no memory requests and limits, then the Usage vs Requests ratio cannot be computed. In this case, the chart will show “no data”. Drill down to the Dashboard in Explore to evaluate the actual usage. You must configure requests. It helps to detect Workloads that require reconfiguration. Kubernetes itself might expose Workloads with no requests or limits configured. For example, the kube-system Namespace can have Workloads without requests configured. Network I\/O The chart shows the latest value returned by avg(avg(net.bytes.total)) . What Is It? The sparkline shows the trend of network traffic (inbound and outbound) for the Workload. The number shows the most recent rate, expressed in bytes per second in a specific unit. For reference, the sparklines show the following number of steps (sampling): Last hour : 6 steps, each for a 10-minute time slice Last 6 hours : 12 steps, each for a 30-minute time slice Last day : 12 steps, each for a 2-hour time slice What to Expect? The type of application runs in the Workload determines the metrics. Drill down to the Kubernetes Overview Dashboard corresponding to the Workload in Explore .

"body" : "Sysdig Monitor imports data related to entities such as hosts, containers, processes, and so on, and reports them in tables or panels on the Explore and Dashboards UI, as well as in events, so across the UI you see varieties of data. The term n\/a can appear anywhere on the UI where some form of data is displayed. n\/a is a term that indicates data that is not available or that it does not apply to a particular instance. In Sysdig parlance, the term signifies one or more entities defined by a particular label, such as hostname or Kubernetes service, for which the label is invalid. In other words, n\/a collectively represent entities whose metadata is not relevant to aggregation and filtering techniques—Grouping, Scoping, and Segmenting. For instance, a list of Kubernetes services might display the list of all the services as well as n\/a that includes all the containers without the metadata describing a Kubernetes service. You might encounter n\/a sporadically in Explore table as well as in drill-down panels or dashboards, events, and likely elsewhere on the Sysdig Monitor UI when no relevant metadata is available for that particular display. How n\/a should be treated depends on the nature of your deployment. The deployment will not be affected by the entities marked n\/a. The following are some of the cases that yield n\/a on the UI: Labels are partially available or not available. For example, a host has entities that are not associated with a monitored Kubernetes deployment, or a monitored host has an unmonitored Kubernetes deployment running. Labels that do not apply to the grouping criteria or at the hierarchy level. For example: Containers that are not managed by Kubernetes. The containers managed by Kubernetes are identified with their  container.name labels. In certain groupings by DaemonSet, Deployments render N\/A and vice versa. Not all containers belong to both DaemonSet and Deployment objects concurrently. Likewise, a Kubernetes ReplicaSet grouping with the  kubernetes.replicaset.name  label will not show StatefulSets. In a  kubernetes.cluster.name > kubernetes.namespace.name > kubernetes.deployment.name  grouping, the entities without the  kubernetes.cluster.name label yield n\/a. Entities are incorrectly labeled in the infrastructure. Kubernetes features that are yet to be in sync with Sysdig Monitoring. The format is not applicable to a particular record in the database.

"body" : "Because custom metrics and their labels can grow to millions of entries, they are indexed by the system, and a \"metrics lifecycle\" is imposed both on them and their labels. This improves performance and prevents cluttering the system with a short-lived container or metric names. Sysdig Monitor maintains an index of all the custom metrics and the custom labels that have reported data in the last 14 days. Each indexed metric\/label is available when configuring new or existing artifacts, i.e. dashboards, scopes, alerts, and so on. When the system does not receive any data for a metric\/label for more than 14 days, or a metric\/label is found that has never reported data (for example, it was never added to the metric index), it is removed from the index if present, and marked as missing . Missing metrics are different from instances where a panel\/dashboard states that \" Metric data is not available \". A missing metric\/label is still available for data queries and charts. Existing artifacts are not affected. However, it is not possible to configure new artifacts with a missing metric\/label, or to update existing artifacts unless the missing metrics\/labels are removed from the configuration. If new data is received for a missing metric\/label, we put it back into the index and the above limitations are removed. Custom metric labels and metrics that have passed their expiry date can be recovered by ingesting a single metric with the same name\/label into the system. (Simply start a container that will send a metric with the same label-- it doesn't have to be the same container that generated the metric you are trying to recover.) This will update the metric index and the label and any historic data will be available for viewing again (subject to normal data retention limits). What You See in the UI If you configured a dashboard three months ago and a metric in it is now missing, when you go to the dashboard and update it in the dashboard settings, a warning appears below the metric stating that the metric is missing.

"body" : "Time aggregation comes into effect in two overlapping situations: Charts can only render a limited number of data points. To look at a wide range of data, Sysdig Monitor may need to aggregate granular data into larger samples for visualization. Sysdig Monitor rolls up historical data over time. Sysdig retains rollups based on each aggregation type, to allow users to choose which data points to utilize when evaluating older data. Sysdig agents collect 1-second samples and report data at 10-second resolution. The data is stored and reported every 10-second with the available aggregations (average, rate, min, max, sum) to make them available via the Sysdig Monitor UI and the API. For time series charts covering five minutes or less, data points are drawn at this 10-second resolution, and any time aggregation selections will have no effect. When an amount of time greater than five minutes is displayed, data points are drawn as an aggregate for an appropriate time interval. For example, for a chart covering one hour, each data point would reflect a one minute interval. At time intervals of one minute and above, charts can be configured to display different aggregates for the 10-second metrics used to calculate each datapoint. Aggregation Type Description average The average of the retrieved metric values across the time period. rate The average value of the metric across the time period evaluated. maximum The highest value during the time period evaluated. minimum The lowest value during the time period evaluated. sum The combined sum of the metric across the time period evaluated. In the example images below, the kubernetes.deployment.replicas.available metrics first uses the average for time aggregation: Then uses the sum for time aggregation: Rate and average are very similar and often provide the same result. However, the calculation of each is different. If time aggregation is set to one minute, the agent is supposed to retrieve six samples (one every 10 seconds). In some cases, samples may not be there, due to disconnections or other circumstances. For this example, four samples are available. If this was the case, the average would be calculated by dividing by four, while the rate would be calculated by dividing by six. Most metrics are sampled once for each time interval, resulting in average and rate returning the same value. However, there will be a distinction for any metrics not reported at every time interval. For example, some custom statsd metrics. Rate is currently referred to as timeAvg in the Sysdig Monitor API and advanced alerting language. By default, average is used when displaying data points for a time interval. " },

There are several different types of group aggregation: Aggregation Type Description average The average value of the interval's samples. maximum The maximum value of the interval's samples. minimum The minimum value of the interval's samples. sum The combined value of all of the interval's samples. If a chart or alert is segmented, the group aggregation settings will be utilized for both aggregations across the whole group, and aggregation within each individual segmentation. For example, the image below shows a chart for CPU% across the infrastructure: When segmented by proc.name , the chart shows one CPU% line for each process: Each line provides the average value for every process with the same name.

Select the first level label either by clicking the desired label, or searching for the label, then clicking it. Define how the value relates to the label, and define the value. Scope editor restricts the scope of the selection for subsequent filters by rendering values that are specific to the selected labels. For example, if the value of the kubernetes.namespace.name label is kube-system , the values of the subsequent label, container.name will be filtered by kube-system.

"body" : "Topology View provides an interactive, animated interface to visualize how different components in your system interact with each other in real time. The interface by default renders a selected host's top processes and their interaction with processes on remote hosts or host groups. Entities in any valid logical grouping can be visually represented with Topology View. The interaction is depicted as nodes and links. Links connect nodes. Nodes and links radially expand from the left. Nodes : The entities participating in network communication. A node could be a process, a container, a host, or any label identified by Sysdig Agent. For example: kubernetes.pod.name. The limit imposed on the maximum number of nodes that can be visualized is as follows: host groups (hosts in a region): 20 hosts: 20 containers: 20 processes: 10 This limit applies to the entities at any node level. Links : The network connection between nodes. Hosts and their child processes ( host.hostName > proc.name) serve as the default grouping for the Topology View. Scaling a Topology View is limited by the number of processes and connections. Sysdig Monitor creates the Topology View by identifying network endpoints (IP addresses) derived from system call data. Topology View in the Explore tab provides pre-defined dashboards to represent CPU Usage , Network Traffic , and Response Time metrics, and as such, they are not configurable. It serves as a template diagnostic tool that provides bottom-up inter-process connection metrics as graphs.

"body" : "The UI allows you to zoom in, zoom out, fit, pan, and reset the display, and expand and collapse the nodes. Zoom into an entity by clicking the associated + icon and view the top processes within the selected entity. You can expand the hosts to see individual processes running inside and corresponding metric value. The links indicating network connections are rendered between entities in the selected hierarchy and, when zoomed, between processes and entities. Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom the content, then left-click and drag to move the map components within the window. Topology View uses legends and color schemes. This section explains what they mean. The line width (thickness) of the links expresses metric values relative to other connections in the system. Scaling line width is relative to the metric values associated with each link. Topology View dynamically adjusts the legend as the data recorded for each connection changes. The thin black line(—): Lower metric values. The thick black line( — ): Higher metric values. Dashed lines(---): A previously existed connection. For example, an active connection between node A and B, rendered as a solid line, could dissolve after a data update if that connection does not exist anymore in the new data set. Instead of removing it from the graph, Sysdig Monitor depicts the inactive connection as a dotted line until the next data update. If the connection returns in a subsequent data update, it is rendered again as a solid line. If the connection does not exist, the line will be removed. The color scheme is determined by color coding for the customizable threshold. The nodes are identified by five colors: Green indicates the node is healthy. Yellow indicates the node is in a warning state. Red indicates the node is in a critical state. Grey indicates the node state is unknown. An unknown node typically signifies a node where no Sysdig Agent installed. Light Blue indicates no threshold is defined for the metrics. " },

Each dashboard is built around the Golden Signals approach to monitoring: Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation. Resource utilization metrics are oriented toward health and performance. These are aspects like CPU, memory, network, and storage usage by Kubernetes object. kube-state-metrics is about the status or count. Pairing kube-state-metrics with resource utilization metrics, each dashboard provides a comprehensive picture of what’s happening in your Kubernetes environment. Dashboard Description Use Cases Kubernetes Cluster Overview Provides an overview of your Kubernetes cluster. Identify performance bottlenecks. Locate logical entities that are consuming too many cluster resources, or that are rapidly trending upwards towards unsustainable levels. Dive deeper into specific entities to identify the root cause of problems. Use usage percentages over time to better estimate expansion capacity. For example: A deployment with no available pods indicates that the corresponding app is not serving requests. Getting a dashboard on this condition means you can visualize the metrics and spring into action to find and resolve the issue quickly. Dropping the number of pods available and remaining below the desired number indicate that your application performance is degraded or not running at the redundancy required. With these metrics represented on the dashboard, you get a quick glance of the severity of the impact on your app's user experience. A lower number of replicas running during an extended period of time than the number of replicas desired indicates a symptom of entities not working properly, such as nodes or resources unavailability, Kubernetes or Docker Engine failure, broken Docker images, and so on. No replicas for a deployment object could potentially mean that the app is down. A continuous loop of pod restart (CrashLoopBackOff) might be associated with missing dependencies or unmet requirements, or insufficient resources. In CrashLoopBackOff, pods never get into ready status and therefore are counted as unavailable and down. Kubernetes Deployment Overview Highlights whether each deployment has a sufficient number of available pods and resources, and indicates the number of pods running, desired, or have been updated. Kubernetes Namespace Overview Displays metrics such as resource requests and resource limits at the namespace level; identifies the performance of the Kubernetes entities such as pods, deployments, DaemonSet, Statefulset, and jobs, and compliance with replicaSets specs. Highlights the number of services, deployments, replicaSets, and jobs per namespace. Kubernetes Node Overview Highlights the number of nodes that are ready, unavailable, or out of disk; the number of nodes that are under the memory, disk, or network pressure; compares allocatable capacity with requested capacity on the node; provides the number of pod resources of a node that are available for scheduling and the available capacity to serve the pods running on the nodes. Kubernetes Pod Overview Helps identify potential bottlenecks by graphing the number of container restarts, the number of pods waiting to be scheduled, resource utilization of containers within each pod and available capacity to serve pod requests, the number of available pods compared to the desired pods, and the number of pods in available state and ready to serve requests. Kubernetes StatefulSet Overview Overview of the StatefulSet objects in your environment. Kubernetes DaemonSet Overview Overview of DaemonSet objects. Kubernetes Job Overview Overview of all the jobs and the performance information. Kubernetes ReplicaSet Overview Provides details such as the number of pods per replicaSet, the desired number of pods per replicaSet, and pods per replicaSet that are in a ready state. Workloads CPU Usage and Allocation Displays resource utilization of your workloads. Workloads Memory Usage and Allocation Displays memory utilization of your workloads. CPU Allocation Optimization Highlights CPU allocation optimization. Memory Allocation Optimization Highlights Memory allocation optimization. Kubernetes Health Overview Provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of the entire Kubernetes environment, broken down by various logical entities and underlying resource availability and usage. This dashboard breaks down resource and performance kube-state-metrics by the logical Kubernetes entities, such as pods, namespaces, deployments, and replicaSets, containers, and so on. Use these three dashboards to provide a high-level overview of all aspects of the Kubernetes environment's performance and resource saturation status. Set high-level alerts to narrow down areas of concern, before moving to the more in-depth dashboards. Quickly identify major performance issues within each type of entity. Kubernetes Cluster and Node Capacity Highlights a comprehensive overview of the performance of the hosts or nodes that form the Kubernetes cluster, including CPU, memory, and file system usage, and network traffic. Before analyzing the Dashboard, consider the following guidelines related to resource usage: If Resource Limits is undefined for a container, Kubernetes does not default to a value. if Resource Requests is unspecified for a container, Kubernetes defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Limits do not default to any value. If both Resource Limits and Resource Requests are not specified, no matter which value had been defaulted by Kubernetes, kube-state-metric (and hence Sysdig Monitor) reports zero. Therefore, only user-defined requested are reported by the kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte metric . The memory used by a container (the value returned by memory.used.bytes) can be greater than the memory requested by a pod (the value returned by kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte) . This is permissible in Kubernetes because Requests value determines the minimum amount of resources required. For these reasons, it can be deduced that In some cases, the value of Used Resources will be more than that of Resource Requests and Resource Limits, and the value of Resource RequestS could be more than that of Resource Limit. The value of kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte <= memory.used.bytes <= kubernetes.pod.resourceLimits.memByte " },

"body" : "Steps Description Decide What to monitor Determine what type of problem you want to be alerted on. See Alert Types to choose a type of problem. Define how it will be monitored Specify exactly what behavior triggers a violation. For example, Marathon App is down on the Kubernetes Cluster named Production for ten minutes. Decide Where to monitor Narrow down your environment to receive fine-tuned results. Use Scope to choose an entity that you want to keep a close watch on. Specify additional segments (entities) to give context to the problem. For example, in addition to specifying a Kubernetes cluster, add a namespace and deployment to refine your scope. Define when to notify Define the threshold and time window for assessing the alert condition. Single Alert fires an alert for your entire scope, while Multiple Alert fires if any or every segment breach the threshold at once. Multiple Alerts include all the segments you specified to uniquely identify the location and thus provides full qualification of where the problem occurred. The higher the number of segments the easier to uniquely identify the affected entities. A good analogy for multiple alerts is alerting on cities. For example, creating multiple alerts on San Francisco would trigger an alert which will include information such as the country that it is part of is the USA and the continent is North America. Trigger gives you control over how notifications are created. For example, you may want to receive a notification for every violation, or want only a single notification for a series of consecutive violations. Decide how notifications are sent Alert supports customizable notification channels, including email, mobile push notifications, OpsGenie, Slack, and more. To see supported services, see . Set Up Notification Channels To create alerts, simply: Choose an Alert Type . Configure alert parameters . Configure the notification channels you want to use for alert notification. Set Up Notification Channels Sysdig sometimes deprecates outdated metrics. Alerts that use these metrics will not be modified or disabled, but will no longer be updated. See .

This section covers general instructions to help you acquainted with and navigate the Alerts user interface. To configure an alert, Open the Alert Wizard and set the following parameters: (Setup): Type: Select the desired Alert Type . Each type has different parameters, but they follow the same pattern: Name: Specify a meaningful name that can uniquely represent the Alert that you are creating. For example, the entity that alert targets, such as Production Cluster Failed Scheduling pods . Description (optional): Briefly expand on the alert name or alert condition to give additional context for the recipient. Priority: High, Medium, Low, and Info are reflected in the Events list, where you can sort by the severity of the Event\/Alert. Parameters in Define , Notify , and Act sections (1) Define: Metric : Select a metric or entity that this alert will monitor. You also define how the data is aggregated, such as avg, max, min or sum. Metrics are applied to a group of items (group aggregation). To alert on multiple metrics using boolean logic, click Create multi-condition alerts . See Multi-Condition Alerts . Scope : Everywhere, or a more limited scope to filter a specific component of the infrastructure monitored, such as a Kubernetes deployment, a Sysdig Agent, or a specific service. Trigger : Boundaries for assessing the alert condition, and whether to send a single alert or multiple alerts. Supported time scales are minute , hour , or day . Single alert: Single Alert fires an alert for your entire scope. Multiple alerts: Multiple Alert fires if any or every segment breaches the threshold at once. Multiple alerts are triggered for each segment you specify. The specified segments will be represented in alerts. The higher the number of segments the easier to uniquely identify the affected entities. For detailed description, see respective sections on Alert Types. (2) Notify Notification Channel: Select from the configured notification channels in the list. Supported channels are: Email Slack Amazon SNS Topic Opsgenie Pagerduty VictorOps Webhook Notification Options: Set the time interval at which multiple alerts should be sent. Format Message: I f applicable, add message format details. See Customize Notifications. (3) Act (Optional): Configure a Sysdig capture. See also Captures .

Modify the subject, body, or both of the alert notification with the following: Plaintext: A custom message stating the problem. For example, Stalled Deployment. Hyperlink: For example, URL to a Dashboard. Dynamic Variable: For example, a hostname. Note the conventions: All variables that you insert must be enclosed in double curly braces, such as {{file_mount}} . Variables are case sensitive. The variables should correspond to the segment values you created the alert for. For example, if an alert is segmented by host.hostName and container.name , the corresponding variables will be {{host.hostName}} and {{container.name}} respectively, and no other segment variables are allowed in the notification subject and body. Notification subjects will not show up on the Event feed. Using a variable that is not a part of the segment will trigger an error. The segment variables used in an alert are turned to the current system values upon sending the alert. The body of the notification message contains a Default Alert Template.

The panel displays the value returned by the metric query specified in the  Query  tab. The value is determined by the data source and the query. Each datapoint will have an associated raw and an option to add columns for additional metric values. Configuring Table Panel Major features include but not limited to : Queries The first query you build cannot be removed. With subsequent queries are built, you cannot remove all the queries except the first one. Changing the unit of the query changes the unit in the table as well. Changing the display format on the query reflects on the row values. Segmentation The segmentation label determines the column name. The segmentation in conjunction with metric values determines the values displayed on the rows. Scope The selected scope determines the values displayed on the table. Metric \/ Labels Columns Adding a new query insert a new column with the name of the metric as the column heading. Metric values in conjunction with segmentation determine the values displayed on the rows. Sorting Column sorting is based on the selected column header and the type of sorting (ascending and descending). When another column is sorted, the table is resorted by that column, resetting the previous sorting. Resizing Grab the header column by the borderline to resize the columns. Browser window resizes shouldn’t reset the resize of the columns if you have resized any columns. When resizing the browser window, table columns are resized to cover the full width. An exception is when you have already resized columns. In such cases, other columns that you have not resized are resized on browser window resize. The last column in the table is not resizable. Export The table by default shows a maximum of 50 rows. Clicking on Export all results... below the table opens the Export Data window. Export data in either JSON or CVS format to a file. The default name of the file is the panel name. Renaming the default filename is permissible. For information on configuring a chart, see . " },

"body" : "The Kubernetes * Health dashboards break down resource and performance metrics by various logical entities to allow for an in-depth analysis, and for critical issues to be identified and isolated. Each dashboard is built around the Golden Signals approach to monitoring: Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation. Resource utilization metrics are oriented toward health and performance. These are aspects like CPU, memory, network, and storage usage by Kubernetes object. kube-state-metrics is about the status or count. Pairing kube-state-metrics with resource utilization metrics, each dashboard provides a comprehensive picture of what’s happening in your Kubernetes environment. Dashboard Description Use Cases Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Highlights minimum, maximum, current, and desired replicas. Identify performance bottlenecks. Identify whether there are enough available pods compared to the desired pods. Use usage percentages over time to better estimate expansion capacity. Locate logical entities that are consuming too many cluster resources, or that are rapidly trending upwards towards unsustainable levels. Dive deeper into specific entities to identify the root cause of problems. Use usage percentages over time to better estimate expansion capacity. For example: A deployment with no available pods indicates that the corresponding app is not serving requests. Getting a dashboard on this condition means you can visualize the metrics and spring into action to find and resolve the issue quickly. Dropping the number of pods available and remaining below the desired number indicate that your application performance is degraded or not running at the redundancy required. With these metrics represented on the dashboard, you get a quick glance of the severity of the impact on your app's user experience. A lower number of replicas running during an extended period of time than the number of replicas desired indicates a symptom of entities not working properly, such as nodes or resources unavailability, Kubernetes or Docker Engine failure, broken Docker images, and so on. No replicas for a deployment object could potentially mean that the app is down. A continuous loop of pod restart (CrashLoopBackOff) might be associated with missing dependencies or unmet requirements, or insufficient resources. In CrashLoopBackOff, pods never get into ready status and therefore are counted as unavailable and down. Use these three dashboards to provide a high-level overview of all aspects of the Kubernetes environment's performance and resource saturation status. Set high-level alerts to narrow down areas of concern, before moving to the more in-depth dashboards. Quickly identify major performance issues within each type of entity. Kubernetes Resource Quota Provides an overview of resource limit and request, and the number of replication controllers, services, service ports, service load balancers, configMap, and secrets. Kubernetes Memory Allocation Optimization Highlights Memory allocation optimization. Kubernetes CPU Allocation Optimization Displays CPU utilization of your Kubernetes environment. Kubernetes Cluster Overview Provides an overview of your Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes DaemonSet Overview Overview of DaemonSet objects. Kubernetes Deployment Overview Highlights whether each deployment has a sufficient number of available pods and resources, and indicates the number of pods running, desired, or have been updated. Kubernetes Job Overview Overview of all the jobs and the performance information. Kubernetes Namespace Overview Displays metrics such as resource requests and resource limits at the namespace level; identifies the performance of the Kubernetes entities such as pods, deployments, DaemonSet, Statefulset, and jobs, and compliance with replicaSets specs. Highlights the number of services, deployments, replicaSets, and jobs per namespace. Kubernetes Node Overview Highlights the number of nodes that are ready, unavailable, or out of disk; the number of nodes that are under the memory, disk, or network pressure; compares allocatable capacity with requested capacity on the node; provides the number of pod resources of a node that are available for scheduling and the available capacity to serve the pods running on the nodes. Kubernetes Pod Overview Helps identify potential bottlenecks by graphing the number of container restarts, the number of pods waiting to be scheduled, resource utilization of containers within each pod and available capacity to serve pod requests, the number of available pods compared to the desired pods, and the number of pods in available state and ready to serve requests. Kubernetes ReplicaSet Overview Provides details such as the number of pods per replicaSet, the desired number of pods per replicaSet, and pods per replicaSet that are in a ready state. Kubernetes StatefulSet Overview Overview of the StatefulSet objects in your environment. Kubernetes Cluster and Node Capacity Highlights a comprehensive overview of the performance of the hosts or nodes that form the Kubernetes cluster, including CPU, memory, and file system usage, and network traffic. Before analyzing the Dashboard, consider the following guidelines related to resource usage: If Resource Limits is undefined for a container, Kubernetes does not default to a value. if Resource Requests is unspecified for a container, Kubernetes defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Limits do not default to any value. If both Resource Limits and Resource Requests are not specified, no matter which value had been defaulted by Kubernetes, kube-state-metric (and hence Sysdig Monitor) reports zero. Therefore, only user-defined requested are reported by the kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte metric . The memory used by a container (the value returned by memory.used.bytes) can be greater than the memory requested by a pod (the value returned by kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte) . This is permissible in Kubernetes because Requests value determines the minimum amount of resources required. For these reasons, it can be deduced that In some cases, the value of Used Resources will be more than that of Resource Requests and Resource Limits, and the value of Resource RequestS could be more than that of Resource Limit. The value of kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte <= memory.used.bytes <= kubernetes.pod.resourceLimits.memByte Kubernetes Health Overview Provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of the entire Kubernetes environment, broken down by various logical entities and underlying resource availability and usage. This dashboard breaks down resource and performance kube-state-metrics by the logical Kubernetes entities, such as pods, namespaces, deployments, and replicaSets, containers, and so on. Kubernetes Service Health Displays the count, resource usage, performance, and limitations of services running in the Kuberenetes environment. The dashboard provides and overview of what resources each service is using, their response times, the container and request counts, and how the response times measure up against the resource utilization.

Specifically, the metadata URL will be of the format https:\/\/HOSTNAME\/FederationMetadata\/2007-06\/FederationMetadata.xml . Also, so that the Sysdig platform can access this URL directly, this host must resolve in DNS and have a valid ( not self-signed) SSL\/TLS certificate. Add a Relying Party Trust configuration for the Sysdig application. Right-click to Relying Party Trusts > Add Relying Party Trust and click Start to begin the wizard. In the Select Data Source step, click the button to Enter data about the relying party manually , then click Next Enter a Display name of your choosing (e.g. \"Sysdig Monitor\" or \"Sysdig Secure\"), then click Next Click Next to accept the default option to use AD FS profile Click Next to skip the selection of an optional token encryption certificate (Sysdig does not support this option) Check the box to Enable support for the SAML 2.0 Web SSO protocol , then enter one of the following values for Relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URL : If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter: https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/saml\/auth If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter: https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com\/api\/saml\/secureAuth Then click Next. For the Relying party trust identifier , enter one of the following values: If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter: https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter: https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com Then click Add , then click Next Click Next to skip configuration of multi-factor authentication Choose a policy for whether users will be permitted to login to the Sysdig application. The default to Permit all users to access the relying party will typically be acceptable. Click Next . Review the summary and click Next to complete the configuration of the Relying Party Trust The next step will involve adding Claim Rules, so you can leave the box checked to Open the Edit Claim Rules dialog and click the Close button to be brought immediately into the Claim Rules editor Ensure that the SamlResponseSignature option matches the Sysdig authentication configuration. Use the Set-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust\/Get-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust  cmdlets via PowerShell to configure SamlResponseSignature . -SamlResponseSignature\nSpecifies the response signatures that the relying party expects. The acceptable values for this parameter are:\n\nAssertionOnly\nMessageAndAssertion\nMessageOnly For more information, see Set-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust . Navigate to Settings > Authentication on the Sysdig app and check the Sysdig authentication setting maps to the SamlResponseSignature : For MessageAndAssertion , enable both the options. Next, use the Claim Rules to ensure that login data is sent as needed to the Sysdig platform. A user's login to the Sysdig platform is based on an email address, and a default ADFS configuration would not send the email address as required. The following configuration ensures the correct field from Active Directory is delivered in the claim. If not already in the Claim Rules editor from the previous step, navigate to it by right-clicking on the Relying Party Trust that was just created and selecting Edit Claim Rules Click Add Rule . At the following screen, accept the default rule template to Send LDAP Attributes as Claims and click Next . Enter a name for the rule, select Active Directory as the Attribute store , then use the pull-down selectors to pick E-Mail Address as both the LDAP Attribute and Outgoing Claim Type , then similarly make pull-down selections for Given Name and Surname . Once these selections are made, click Finish . Now click Add Rule again, this time selecting the template for Transform an incoming claim Enter a name for the rule, then use the pull-downs to select an Incoming claim type of E-Mail Address , an Outgoing claim type of Name ID , and an Outgoing name ID format of Email , then click Finish . (Optional) If you want the user's First Name and Last Name to be included in the records created in the Sysdig platform database when new users successfully login via SAML for the first time, additional Transform rules must also be created. Only the email-based username is strictly required and we already created a rule for this, so this step is optional. If you wish to do this, click Add Rule and once again select the template for Transform an incoming claim . Enter a name for the rule, then use the pull-down to select an Incoming claim type of Given Name , and for the Outgoing claim type , directly type first name into the field. After clicking Finish , click Add Rule and create a similar rule to transform the Incoming claim type of Surname to the Outgoing claim type of last name . Having clicked Finish after creating your last rule, you will see all rules now in the editor. You can click Ok , and your ADFS configuration for your Sysdig application is complete. It can be tested once Sysdig Support has completed their side of the configuration using the metadata URL you send in your Support request. " },

"body" : "(Optional) The steps above represent a Service-Provider-Initiated SAML configuration. If you would prefer an IdP-initiated SAML configuration, this is also possible with ADFS, but requires the additional steps described below. The Sysdig platform requires a specific setting of RelayState in order to accept IdP-initiated login flows. On the ADFS versions tested, we've found this use of RelayState is disabled by default, and a Microsoft article describes the topic in detail. To enable it, as described in a Microsoft forum thread , on your ADFS host, edit %systemroot%\\ADFS\\Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config and add <useRelayStateForIdpInitiatedSignOn enabled=\"true\" \/> to the <microsoft.identityserver.web> section. Once the modification is saved, restart ADFS services for the change to take effect. You will need to retrieve your Sysdig customer number as described in the Find Your Customer Number article. Find Your Customer Number You will then need to generate an IdP-initiated login URL. In addition to having the correct settings, it must be properly URL encoded. To ease this configuration, use this ADFS RelayState Generator tool. When launched, enter the values below, then hit the Generate URL button. For the IDP URL String , enter https:\/\/YOUR_ADFS_SERVER\/adfs\/ls\/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx For the Relying Party Identifier , enter one of the following values: If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com For the Relay State\/Target App , enter #\/&customer=CUSTOMER-ID-NUMBER , substituting the CUSTOMER-ID-NUMBER you retrieved in the previous step This Results URL will be used in the metadata URL that you paste in the Metadata entry in the SAML connection settings . SAML (SaaS) Use the Results URL from the tool to test your IdP-initiated login. Note that per this Microsoft forum thread , it is apparently not possible to configure ADFS to use such a URL when your users select the application from the pull-down menu at https:\/\/YOUR_ADFS_SERVER\/adfs\/ls\/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx . However, you may embed the URL into a custom portal or bookmarks list. Now you can test login using an Active Directory user that has an Email address configured. " },

"body" : "This section describes how to configure Sysdig Monitor to utilize the Amazon Web Service (AWS) AssumeRole functionality and authorize Sysdig Monitor to discover cloud assets, grab CloudWatch metrics from your AWS account, and utilize custom S3 bucket for storing captures. Upon integrating with an AWS role, you can delegate access to AWS resources that are not associated with your Sysdig AWS account. Setting up cross-account access through roles eliminates the need to create individual IAM users in each account. In addition, users don't have to sign out of one account and sign in to another in order to access resources in different AWS accounts. Role delegation is an alternative to the existing integration method using the access keys. This method is considered secure as sharing developer access keys with third-parties is not recommended by Amazon. " },

"body" : "Independent of the Auto-Config feature, typical Agent configuration lives in \/opt\/draios\/etc and is derived from a combination of base config in the dragent.default.yaml file and any overrides that may be present in dragent.yaml . See also Understanding the Agent Config Files . Agent Auto-Config adds a middle layer of possible overrides in an additional file dragent.auto.yaml .When present, the the order of config application from highest precedence to lowest now becomes: dragent.yaml dragent.auto.yaml dragent.default.yaml While all Agents are by default prepared to receive and make use of Auto-Config data, the file dragent.auto.yaml will not be present on an Agent until you've pushed central Auto-Config data to be applied to that Agent. Auto-Config settings are performed via Sysdig Monitor's REST API. Simplified examples are available that use the Python client library to get or set current Auto-Config settings. Detailed examples using the REST API are shown below. The REST endpoint for Auto-Config is \/api\/agents\/config . Use the GET method to review the current configuration. The following example shows the initial empty settings that result in no dragent.auto.yaml files being present on your Agents. curl -X GET \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config\n \n \nOutput:\n{\n \"files\": []\n} Use the PUT method to centrally push YAML that will be distributed and applied to your Agents as dragent.auto.yaml files. The content parameter must contain syntactically-correct YAML. The filter option is used to specify if the config should be sent to one agent or all of them, such as in this example to globally enable Debug logging on all Agents: curl -X PUT \\\n --header \"Content-Type: application\/json\" \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config -d '\n{\n \"files\": [\n {\n \"filter\": \"*\",\n \"content\": \"log:\\n console_priority: debug\"\n }\n ]\n}' Alternatively, the filter can specify a hardware MAC address for a single Agent that should receive a certain YAML config. All MAC-specific configs should appear at the top of the JSON object and are not additive to any global Auto-Config specified with \"filter\": \"*\" at the bottom. For example, when the following config is applied, the one Agent that has the app check configured would not have Debug logging enabled, but all others would. MySQL curl -X PUT \\\n --header \"Content-Type: application\/json\" \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config -d '\n{\n \"files\": [\n {\n \"filter\": \"host.mac = \\\"08:00:27:de:5b:b9\\\"\",\n \"content\": \"app_checks:\\n - name: mysql\\n pattern:\\n comm: mysqld\\n conf:\\n server: 127.0.0.1\\n user: sysdig-cloud\\n pass: sysdig-cloud-password\"\n },\n {\n \"filter\": \"*\",\n \"content\": \"log:\\n console_priority: debug\"\n }\n ]\n}' To update the active central Auto-Config settings, simply PUT a complete replacement JSON object. All connected Agents will receive centrally-pushed Auto-Config updates that apply to them based on the filter settings. Any Agent whose Auto-Config is enabled\/disabled\/changed based on the centrally-pushed settings will immediately restart, putting the new configuration into effect. Any central Auto-Config settings that would result in a particular Agent's Auto-Config remaining the same will not trigger a restart. " },

Sysdig agents capture process, network, system and other infrastructure data with a 1-second resolution, and sends them to the Sysdig worker service with a 10-second resolution. The data API allows you to fetch data at the native resolution of 10-second or lower. You can specify the resolution to return data via the sampling parameter. Each resolution has different data retention periods. Since native data capturing is performed with a 1-second resolution, for each metric you need to specify a time aggregation . Similarly, data associated with individual pods, processes, and so can be aggregated at a higher level. For example, at the host or namespace level. This type of aggregation depends on the list of labels you specify. For instance, you could aggregate data at the host level by specifying a host label. For this to work, you need to specify a group aggregation . To learn more about data aggregation, see . " },

Any user of the account won’t be able to access data via API or UI. However, Alerts will not be impacted by the data rate limit. To overcome this limitation, reduce the amount of data to be downloaded at a time from the database. For example, instead of creating two separate requests for two metrics, create a single request to get both the metrics. Use container labels or host labels instead of Kubernetes labels. This prevents all the Kubernetes labels and metrics to be loaded from the database, which is resource-intensive. When necessary, break down requests into node “chunks” and do not make all requests at the same time. For example: kubernetes.cluster.name \/ agent.cluster.name kubernetes.node.name \/ host.hostName agent.id When necessary, specify filters using labels that optimize database access (via indexing). By default, the following labels can be used: agent.id container.image container.image.repo container.image.tag kubernetes.cluster.name kubernetes.namespace.name kubernetes.node.name kubernetes.replicationController.name kubernetes.service.name kubernetes.deployment.name kubernetes.daemonSet.name kubernetes.replicaSet.name kubernetes.statefulSet.name kubernetes.resourcequota.name host.domain host.hostName host.ip.private host.ip.public host.mac If you need to periodically pull data, avoid overlapping requests over time. This will avoid downloading the same data more than once. Use either the Timeline API or get the latest, and calculate older time windows.

You can use Sysdig in the same way that you use Prometheus and leverage Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to create dashboards and alerts. Sysdig is compatible with Prometheus HTTP API to query your monitoring data programmatically using PromQL and extend Sysdig to other platforms like Grafana. From a metric collection standpoint, a lightweight Prometheus server is directly embedded into the Sysdig agent to facilitate metric collection. This also supports targets, instances, and jobs with filtering and relabeling using Prometheus syntax. You can configure the agent to identify these processes that expose Prometheus metric endpoints on its own host and send it to the Sysdig collector for storing and further processing. This document uses metric and time series interchangeably. The description of configuration parameters refers to \"metric\", but in strict Prometheus terms, those imply time series. That is, applying a limit of 100 metrics implies applying a limit on time series, where all the time series data might not have the same metric name. The Prometheus product itself does not necessarily have to be installed for Prometheus metrics collection. Sysdig agent v10.0.0 and above: promscrape , a lightweight Prometheus server, by default is used for scraping Prometheus metrics. The component is based on the Open Source Prometheus. Sysdig agent v9.8.0 to v10.0: promscrape , a lightweight Prometheus server, is introduced in v9.8.0 to scrape Prometheus metrics. You must enable promscrape in the dragent.yaml file to use this method. Sysdig agent v0.70.0 and above: Provides rich support for automatically collecting metrics from Prometheus exporters .

"body" : "The way service discovery works in the Sysdig agent differs from that of the Prometheus server . While the Prometheus server has built-in integration with several service discovery mechanisms and the prometheus.yml  file to read the configuration settings from, Sysdig agent auto-discovers any process (exporter or instrumented) that matches the specifications in the dragent.yaml , file and instructs the embedded lightweight Prometheus server to retrieve the metrics from it. The lightweight Prometheus server in the agent is named promscrape and is controlled by the flag of the same name in the dragent.yaml file. See for more information. Configuring Sysdig Agent Unlike the Prometheus server that can scrape processes running on all the machines in a cluster, the agent can scrape only those processes that are running on the host that it is installed on. Within the set of eligible processes\/ports\/endpoints, the agent scrapes only the ports that are exporting Prometheus metrics and will stop attempting to scrape or retry on ports based on how they respond to attempts to connect and scrape them. It is therefore strongly recommended that you create a configuration that restricts the process and ports for attempted scraping to the minimum expected range for your exporters. This minimizes the potential for unintended side-effects in both the Agent and your applications due to repeated failed connection attempts. The end to end metric collection can be summarized as follows: A process is determined to be eligible for possible scraping if it positively matches against a series of Process Filter include\/exclude rules. See for more information. The Agent will then attempt to scrape an eligible process at a \/metrics endpoint on all of its listening TCP ports unless the additional configuration is present to restrict scraping to a subset of ports and\/or another endpoint name. As of agent v9.8.0, filtering metrics at ingestion can be enabled. If enabled, filtering rules are applied at ingestion as it receives the metrics. See for more information. Upon receiving the metrics, the agent applies the following rules before sending them to the Sysdig collector. Applies the global metrics_filter rules. See . Include\/Exclude Custom Metrics Imposes the configured max_metrics to limit the number of metrics. See . The metrics ultimately appear in the Sysdig Monitor Explore interface in the Prometheus section. " },

Such environments can quickly begin scraping the same metrics using the Sysdig Agent in a couple of easy steps. Enable the Prometheus metrics feature in the Sysdig Agent. Assuming you are deploying using DaemonSets , the needed config can be added to the Agent's dragent.yaml by including the following in your DaemonSet YAML (placing it in the env section for the sysdig-agent container): - name: ADDITIONAL_CONF\n value: \"prometheus:\\n enabled: true\"\n\n Ensure the Kubernetes Pods that contain your Prometheus exporters have been deployed with the following Annotations to enable scraping (substituting the listening exporter-TCP-port) : spec:\n template:\n metadata:\n annotations:\n prometheus.io\/scrape: \"true\"\n prometheus.io\/port: \"exporter-TCP-port\" The configuration above assumes your exporters use the typical endpoint called \/metrics . If an exporter is using a different endpoint, this can also be specified by adding the following additional optional Annotation, substituting the exporter-endpoint-name : \nprometheus.io\/path: \"\/exporter-endpoint-name\" If you try this Kubernetes Deployment of a simple exporter , you will quickly see auto-discovered Prometheus metrics being displayed in Sysdig Monitor.

Note that once you specify a process_filter in your dragent.yaml , this replaces the entire Prometheus process_filter section (i.e. all the rules) shown in the dragent.default.yaml . The Process Filter is specified in a series of include and exclude rules that are evaluated top-to-bottom for each process known by an Agent. If a process matches an include rule, scraping will be attempted via a \/metrics endpoint on each listening TCP port for the process, unless a conf section also appears within the rule to further restrict how the process will be scraped (see below). Multiple patterns can be specified in a single rule, in which case all patterns must match for the rule to be a match (AND logic).

Note that due to YAML syntax, when using wildcards, be sure to enclose the value in quotes ( \"*\" ). The table below describes the supported patterns in Process Filter rules. To provide realistic examples, we'll use a simple sample Prometheus exporter (source code here ) which can be deployed as a container using the Docker command line below.

Note: This pattern does not apply to the Docker-only command-line shown above, but would instead apply if the exporter were installed as a Kubernetes Deployment using this example YAML . Note: See , below, for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. - include: kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape : true process.name Matches the name of the running process - include: process.name : java process.cmdline Matches a command line argument - include: process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\" port Matches if the process is listening on one or more TCP ports. The pattern for a single rule can specify a single port as shown in this example, or a single range (e.g. 8079-8081 ), but does not support comma-separated lists of ports\/ranges. Note: This parameter is only used to confirm if a process is eligible for scraping based on the ports on which it is listening. For example, if a process is listening on one port for application traffic and has a second port open for exporting Prometheus metrics, it would be possible to specify the application port here (but not the exporting port), and the exporting port in the section (but not the application port), and the process would be matched as eligible and the exporting port would be scraped. - include: port: 8080 appcheck.match Matches if an Application Check with the specific name or pattern is scheduled to run for the process. Integrate Applications (Default App Checks) - exclude: appcheck.match: \"*\" Instead of the include examples shown above that would have each matched our process, due to the previously-described ability to combine multiple patterns in a single rule, the following very strict configuration would also have matched: - include:\n container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n container.name: my-java-app\n container.label.class: exporter\n process.name: java\n process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\"\n port: 8080 " },

A Process Filter rule excludes processes that are likely to exist in most environments but are known to never export Prometheus metrics, such as the Docker Proxy and the Agent itself. Another Process Filter rule ensures that any processes configured to be scraped by the legacy Prometheus application check will not be scraped. Another Process Filter rule is tailored to use container Labels. Processes marked with the container Label io.prometheus.scrape will become eligible for scraping, and if further marked with container Labels io.prometheus.port and\/or io.prometheus.path , scraping will be attempted only on this port and\/or endpoint. If the container is not marked with the specified path Label, scraping the \/metrics endpoint will be attempted.

"body" : "Multiple Agents can share the same configuration. Therefore, determine which one of those Agents scrape the remote endpoints with the dragent.yaml file. This is applicable to both Create a separate configuration section for remote services in the Agent configuration file under the prometheus configuration. Include a configuration section for each remote endpoint, and add either a URL or host\/port (and an optional path) parameter to each section to identify the endpoint to scrape. The optional path identifies the resource at the endpoint. An empty path parameter defaults to the \"\/metrics\" endpoint for scraping. Optionally, add custom tags for each endpoint configuration for remote services. In the absence of tags, metric reporting might not work as expected when multiple endpoints are involved. Agents cannot distinguish similar metrics scraped from multiple endpoints unless those metrics are uniquely identified by tags. To help you get started, an example configuration for Kubernetes is given below: prometheus:\n remote_services:\n - prom_1:\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/region: europe\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/scraper: true\n conf:\n url: \"https:\/\/xx.xxx.xxx.xy:5005\/metrics\"\n tags:\n host: xx.xxx.xxx.xy\n service: prom_1\n scraping_node: \"{kubernetes.node.name}\"\n - prom_2:\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/region: india\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/scraper: true\n conf:\n host: xx.xxx.xxx.yx\n port: 5005\n use_https: true\n tags:\n host: xx.xxx.xxx.yx\n service: prom_2\n scraping_node: \"{kubernetes.node.name}\"\n - prom_3:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.sysdig.com\/prom_3_scraper: true\n conf:\n url: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.sysdig.com\/prom_3_url}\"\n tags:\n service: prom_3\n scraping_node: \"{kubernetes.node.name}\"\n - haproxy:\n kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_scraper: true\n conf:\n host: \"mymasternode\"\n port: 1936\n path: \"\/metrics\"\n username: \"{kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_username}\"\n password: \"{kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_password}\"\n tags:\n service: router In the above example, scraping is triggered by node and pod annotations. You can add annotations to nodes and pods by using the kubectl annotate command as follows: \nkubectl annotate node mynode --overwrite sysdig.com\/region=india sysdig.com\/scraper=true haproxy_scraper=true yourhost.com\/haproxy_username=admin yourhost.com\/haproxy_password=admin In this example, you set annotation on a node to trigger scraping of the prom2 and haproxy services as defined in the above configuration.

The authentication methods for local scraping works for authenticating agents on remote hosts as well, but the authorization parameters work only in the agent context. Authentication based on certificate-key pair requires it to be constructed into Kubernetes secret and mounted to the agent.

If the annotation doesn't exist the value will be an empty string. Token substitution is supported for all the authorization parameters. Because authorization works only in the Agent context, credentials cannot be automatically retrieved from the target pod. Therefore, use an annotation in the Agent pod to pass them.

To make this data easier to visualize, the Sysdig Monitor application presents histogram data as a delta over the selected time range.

This section is defined in the agent's default settings file and contains beans and attributes that are going to be polled for every Java process, like memory and garbage collector usage: jmx:\n default_beans:\n - query: \"java.lang:type=Memory\"\n attributes:\n - HeapMemoryUsage\n - NonHeapMemoryUsage\n - query: \"java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,*\"\n attributes:\n - name: \"CollectionCount\"\n type: \"counter\"\n - name: \"CollectionTime\"\n type: \"counter\" Metrics specific for each application are specified in sections named after the applications. For example, this is the Tomcat section: per_process_beans:\n tomcat:\n pattern: \"catalina\"\n beans:\n - query: \"Catalina:type=Cache,*\"\n attributes:\n - accessCount\n - cacheSize\n - hitsCount\n - . . . The key name, tomcat in this case, will be displayed as a process name in the Sysdig Monitor user interface instead of just java . The pattern: parameter specifies a string that is used to match a java process name and arguments with this set of JMX metrics. If the process main class full name contains the given text, the process is tagged and the metrics specified in the section will be fetched. The class names are matched against the process argument list. If you implement JMX metrics in a custom manner that does not expose the class names on the command line, you will need to find a pattern which conveniently matches your java invocation command line. The beans: section contains the list of beans to be queried, based on JMX patterns. JMX patterns are explained in details in the Oracle documentation , but in practice, the format of the query line is pretty simple: you can specify the full name of the bean like java.lang:type=Memory , or you can fetch multiple beans in a single line using the wildcard * as in: java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,* To get the list of all the beans that your application exports, you can use JVisualVM , Jmxterm , JConsole or other similar tools. Here is a screenshot from JConsole showing where to find the namespace, bean and attribute (metric) information (JConsole is available when you install the Java Development Kit): For each query, you can specify the attributes that you want to retrieve. We support the following JMX attributes (For these attributes, all the subattributes will be retrieved): Numeric CompositeDataSupport Attributes may be absolute values or rates. For values, we need to calculate a per second rate before sending them. In this case, you can specify type: counter , the default is rate which can be omitted, so usually you can simply write the attribute name. " },

Aliases can be dynamic as well, getting data from the bean name - useful where you use pattern bean queries. For example: - query: \"java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,*\"\n attributes:\n - name: CollectionCount\n type: counter\n alias: jvm.gc.NAME.count\n - name: CollectionTime\n type: counter\n alias: jvm.gc.NAME.time This query will match multiple beans (All Garbage collectors) and the metric name will reflect the name of the Garbage Collector. For example: jvm.gc.ConcurrentMarkSweep.count . General syntax is: {<bean_property_key>} , to get all beans properties you can use a JMX explorer like JVisualVM or Jmxterm. " },
