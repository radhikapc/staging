"body" : "The resource requirements for the Sysdig agent are subjective to the size and load of the host. Increased activity equates to higher resource requirements. At a minimum, the agent requires 2% of the total CPU and 512 MiB of memory. You might see 5 to 20 KiB\/s of bandwidth consumed. Different variables can increase the throughput required. For example: The number of metrics The number of events Kubernetes objects Products and features enabled When a Sysdig Capture is being collected, you can expect to see a spike in the bandwidth while the capture file is being ingested. Sysdig does not recommend placing bandwidth shaping or caps on the agent to ensure that data is sent to the Sysdig Collection service. In general, in larger clusters, the agent requires more memory, and in servers with a high number of cores, the agent requires more CPU cores to monitor all the system calls. You will use CPU cores on the host and the Kubernetes nodes visible to the agent as proxies for the rate of events processed in the agent. Similarly, there are different factors that are at play, and considering all the factors, we recommend the following: Small : CPU core count <= 8. Kubernetes nodes <=10 Medium : 8 < CPU core count <= 32. 10 < Kubernetes nodes <= 100 Large : CPU core count > 32. Kubernetes nodes > 100 While you can expect the behavior with the given numbers to be better than simply using the default values, Sysdig cannot guarantee that resource allocation will be correct for all the cases.

For example, to match the agent watchdog settings with large values, the agent configuration would be: watchdog:\n max_memory_usage_mb: 2048\n max_memory_usage_subprocesses:\n sdchecks: 128\n sdjagent: 256\n mountedfs_reader: 32\n statsite_forwarder: 32\n cointerface: 4096\n " },

The slim agent reduces the surface area of attack for potential vulnerabilities and is, therefore, more secure. You install the slim agent package as two separate containers: agent-kmodule : Responsible for downloading and building the kernel module. The image is short-lived. The container exits after the kernel module is loaded. The transient nature of the container reduces the time and opportunities for exploiting any potential vulnerabilities present in the container image. Prerequisites : The package depends on Dynamic Kernel Module Support (DKMS) and requires the compiler and kernel headers installed if you are using the agent-kmodule to build the kernel probe. Alternatively, you can use it without the kernel headers. In such cases, the agent-kmodule will attempt to download a pre-built kernel probe if it is present in the Sysdig probe repository. The module contains: The driver sources A post-install script that builds the module upon installation agent-slim : Responsible for running the agent module once the kernel module has been loaded.

These two connections form a tunnel that acts like one logical connection. By default, the agent will encrypt all messages sent through this tunnel. This means that after the initial CONNECT message and response, all the communication on that tunnel is encrypted by SSL end-to-end. This encryption is controlled by the top-level ssl parameter in the agent configuration. Optionally, the agent can add a second layer of encryption, securing the CONNECT message and response. This second layer of encryption may be desired in the case of HTTP authentication if there is a concern that network packet sniffing could be used to determine the user's credentials.

The following configuration options affect the behavior of the HTTP Proxy setting. You specify them under the http_proxy heading in the dragent.yaml file. proxy_host : Indicates the hostname of the proxy server. The default is an empty string, which implies communication through an HTTP proxy is disabled. proxy_port : Specifies the port on the proxy server the agent should connect to. The default is 0, which indicates that the HTTP proxy is disabled. proxy_user : Required if HTTP authentication is configured. This option specifies the username for the HTTP authentication. The default is an empty string, which indicates that authentication is not configured. proxy_password : Required if HTTP authentication is configured. This option specifies the password for the HTTP authentication. The default is an empty string. Specifying proxy_user with no proxy_password is allowed. ssl : If set to true, the connection between the agent and the proxy server is encrypted. Note that this parameter requires the top-level ssl parameter to be enabled, as the agent does not support SSL to the proxy but unencrypted traffic to the collector. This additional security prevents you from misconfiguring the agent assuming the metrics are as well encrypted end-to-end when they are not. ssl_verify_certificate : Determines whether the agent will verify the certificate presented by the proxy. This option is configured independently of the top-level ssl_verify_certificate parameter. This option is enabled by default. If the provided certificate is not correct, this option can cause the connection to the proxy server to fail. ca_certificate : The path to the CA certificate for the proxy server. If ssl_verify_certificate is enabled, the CA certificate must be signed appropriately. " },

"body" : "Sysdig provides a configuration option called Thin Cointerface to reduce the memory footprint in the agent. When the agent is installed as a Kubernetes daemonset, you can optionally enable the Thin Cointerface in the sysdig-agent configmap . In a typical Kubernetes cluster, two instances of agent daemonset are installed to retrieve the data. They are automatically connected to the Kubernetes API server to retrieve the metadata associated with the entities running on the cluster and sends the global Kubernetes state to the Sysdig backend. Sysdig uses this data to generate Kube State Metrics. A delegated agent will not have a higher CPU or memory footprint than a non-delegated agent. On very large Kubernetes clusters (in the range of 10,000 pods) or clusters with several Replication Controllers, the agent's data ingestion can have a significant memory footprint on itself and on the Kubernetes API server. Thin Cointerface is provided to reduce this impact. Enabling this option changes the way the agent communicates with the API server and reduces the need to cache data, which in turn reduces the overall memory usage. Thin Cointerface does this by moving some processing from the agent’s cointerface process to the dragent process. This change does not alter the data which is ultimately sent to the backend nor will it impact any Sysdig feature. The thin cointerface feature is disabled by default. To enable: Add the following in either the sysdig-agent’s configmap or via the dragent.yaml file: thin_cointerface_enabled: true Restart the agent. " },

The default level ( info ) creates an entry for each aggregated metrics transmission to the backend servers, once per second, in addition to entries for any warnings and errors. Setting the value lower than info may prohibit troubleshooting agent-related issues. The type and amount of logging can be changed by adding parameters and log level arguments shown below to the agent's user settings configuration file here: \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml After editing the dragent.yaml file, restart the agent at the shell with: service dragent restart to affect changes. Note that dragent.yaml code can be written in both YAML and JSON. The examples below use YAML. " },

"body" : "Independent of the Auto-Config feature, typical Agent configuration lives in \/opt\/draios\/etc and is derived from a combination of base config in the dragent.default.yaml file and any overrides that may be present in dragent.yaml . See also Understanding the Agent Config Files . Agent Auto-Config adds a middle layer of possible overrides in an additional file dragent.auto.yaml .When present, the the order of config application from highest precedence to lowest now becomes: dragent.yaml dragent.auto.yaml dragent.default.yaml While all Agents are by default prepared to receive and make use of Auto-Config data, the file dragent.auto.yaml will not be present on an Agent until you've pushed central Auto-Config data to be applied to that Agent. Auto-Config settings are performed via Sysdig Monitor's REST API. Simplified examples are available that use the Python client library to get or set current Auto-Config settings. Detailed examples using the REST API are shown below. The REST endpoint for Auto-Config is \/api\/agents\/config . Use the GET method to review the current configuration. The following example shows the initial empty settings that result in no dragent.auto.yaml files being present on your Agents. curl -X GET \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config\n \n \nOutput:\n{\n \"files\": []\n} Use the PUT method to centrally push YAML that will be distributed and applied to your Agents as dragent.auto.yaml files. The content parameter must contain syntactically-correct YAML. The filter option is used to specify if the config should be sent to one agent or all of them, such as in this example to globally enable Debug logging on all Agents: curl -X PUT \\\n --header \"Content-Type: application\/json\" \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config -d '\n{\n \"files\": [\n {\n \"filter\": \"*\",\n \"content\": \"log:\\n console_priority: debug\"\n }\n ]\n}' Alternatively, the filter can specify a hardware MAC address for a single Agent that should receive a certain YAML config. All MAC-specific configs should appear at the top of the JSON object and are not additive to any global Auto-Config specified with \"filter\": \"*\" at the bottom. For example, when the following config is applied, the one Agent that has the MySQL app check configured would not have Debug logging enabled, but all others would. curl -X PUT \\\n --header \"Content-Type: application\/json\" \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config -d '\n{\n \"files\": [\n {\n \"filter\": \"host.mac = \\\"08:00:27:de:5b:b9\\\"\",\n \"content\": \"app_checks:\\n - name: mysql\\n pattern:\\n comm: mysqld\\n conf:\\n server: 127.0.0.1\\n user: sysdig-cloud\\n pass: sysdig-cloud-password\"\n },\n {\n \"filter\": \"*\",\n \"content\": \"log:\\n console_priority: debug\"\n }\n ]\n}' To update the active central Auto-Config settings, simply PUT a complete replacement JSON object. All connected Agents will receive centrally-pushed Auto-Config updates that apply to them based on the filter settings. Any Agent whose Auto-Config is enabled\/disabled\/changed based on the centrally-pushed settings will immediately restart, putting the new configuration into effect. Any central Auto-Config settings that would result in a particular Agent's Auto-Config remaining the same will not trigger a restart. " },

"body" : "The serverless environment: As cloud platforms have evolved, both the convenience and the abstraction levels have increased simultaneously and new agent models are required. For example, with Amazon's ECS and EKS, users remain in charge of managing the underlying virtual host machines. In environments like Fargate , however, the hosts are implicitly allocated by the cloud provider and users simply run their containers without allocating, configuring, or having any knowledge of the underlying compute infrastructure. While this “container as a service” model is convenient, it can introduce risk, as many users leave the containers unattended and don't monitor for security events inside them that can exfiltrate secrets, compromise business data, and increase their AWS\/cloud provider costs. In addition, it is not possible to install a standard agent in an environment where you do not have access to a host. For these reasons, Sysdig has introduced a new “serverless agent” that can be deployed in such container-based cloud environments. " },

"body" : "For Sysdig installations on Kubernetes or OpenShift, version 2.5.0 and above. The Sysdig Installer tool is a binary containing a collection of scripts that help automate the on-premises deployment of the Sysdig platform (Sysdig Monitor and\/or Sysdig Secure), for environments using Kubernetes or OpenShift. Use the Installer to install or upgrade your Sysdig platform. It is recommended as a replacement for the earlier Kubernetes manual installation and upgrade procedures. Installation Overview To install, you will log in to quay.io, download a values.yaml file, provide a few basic parameters in it, and launch the Installer. In a normal installation, the rest is automatically configured and deployed. You can perform a quick install if your environment has access to the internet, or a partial or full airgapped installation, as needed. Each is described below. See Frequently Used Installer Configurations to: Customize or override settings Use hostPath for static storage of Sysdig components Use Kubernetes node labels and taints to run only Sysdig pods on selected nodes in a cluster Quickstart Install This install assumes the Kubernetes cluster has network access to pull images from quay.io. Copy the current version values.yaml to your working directory. wget https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes\/installer\/installer\/values.yaml If you will be editing for an OpenShift installation and want to review a sample, see openshift-with-hostpath values.yaml . Edit the following values: size: Specifies the size of the cluster. Size defines CPU, Memory, Disk, and Replicas. Valid options are: small, medium and large quaypullsecret: quay.io provided with your Sysdig purchase confirmation mail storageClassProvisioner: Review Storage Requirements, above. If you have the default use case, enter aws or gke in the storageClassProvisioner field. Otherwise, refer to Use Case 2 or 3. sysdig.license: Sysdig license key provided with your Sysdig purchase confirmation mail sysdig.dnsname: The domain name the Sysdig APIs will be served on. Note that the master node may not be used as the DNS name when using hostNetwork mode. sysdig.collector.dnsName: (OpenShift installs only) Domain name the Sysdig collector will be served on. When not configured it defaults to whatever is configured for sysdig.dnsName. Note that the master node may not be used as the DNS name when using hostNetwork mode. deployment : (OpenShift installs only) Add deployment: openshift to the root of the values.yaml file. sysdig.ingressNetworking: The networking construct used to expose the Sysdig API and collector.Options are: hostnetwork: sets the hostnetworking in the ingress daemonset and opens host ports for api and collector. This does not create a Kubernetes service. loadbalancer: creates a service of type loadbalancer and expects that your Kubernetes cluster can provision a load balancer with your cloud provider. nodeport: creates a service of type nodeport.The node ports can be customized with: sysdig.ingressNetworkingInsecureApiNodePort sysdig.ingressNetworkingApiNodePort sysdig.ingressNetworkingCollectorNodePort When not configured, sysdig.ingressNetworking defaults to hostnetwork . If doing an airgapped install , you would also edit the following values: airgapped_registry_name: The URL of the airgapped (internal) docker registry. This URL is used for installations where the Kubernetes cluster can not pull images directly from Quay airgapped_repository_prefix: This defines custom repository prefix for airgapped_registry. Tags and pushes images as airgapped_registry_name\/airgapped_repository_prefix\/image_name:tag airgapped_registry_password: The password for the configured airgapped_registry_username. Ignore this parameter if the registry does not require authentication. airgapped_registry_username: The username for the configured airgapped_registry_name. Ignore this parameter if the registry does not require authentication. Download the installer binary that matches your OS from the  sysdigcloud-kubernetes releases page. Run the installer: .\/installer deploy See Output (below) to finish. Save the values.yaml file in a secure location; it will be used for future upgrades. There will also be a generated directory containing various Kubernetes configuration yaml files that were applied by the Installer against your cluster. It is not necessary to keep the generated directory, as the Installer can regenerate it consistently with the same values.yaml file. " },

This guide describes how to install the Replicated client and use it to install and manage the Sysdig platform. Single-Host or Multi-Host Install: For test or proof-of-concept installations, a single-host install will include all components; for production, a distributed environment is needed. Airgapped or non-airgapped environment: If your environment is accessible to the Internet during the install process, then the installation options include both script-based or GUI-based. In airgapped environments (no Internet access), you must download components into your airgapped repository, and can only use the GUI-based installation. See Airgapped Installation . Where to put the Replicated Management Console: When installing on-premises using Replicated as the orchestrator, the following Replicated components will be installed on your system: Replicated UI (on a host you designate to host the Replicated Management Console) Replicated retraced containers that handle logging (on the Management Console host only) Replicated operator component (will go on all hosts) In a multi-host installation, one server will be the Replicated Management Console host.

"body" : "Overview The Installer tool can be used to upgrade a Sysdig implementation. Just as in an installation, you must meet the prerequisites, download the values.yaml , edit the values as indicated, and run the installer. The main difference is that you run it twice: once to discover the differences between the old and new versions and the second time to deploy the new version. As this is a new feature, some guidance from Sysdig Professional Services may be warranted in highly customized installations. Review the Prerequisites and Installation Options for more context, if needed. If you have an airgapped environment, be sure to review Airgapped Installation Options. Upgrade Steps To upgrade: Download the latest installer binary that matches your OS from the sysdigcloud-kubernetes releases page. Copy the current version of values.yaml to your working directory. wget https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes\/installer\/installer\/values.yaml Edit the following values: scripts : set to generate diff. This setting will generate the differences between the installed environment and the upgrade version. The changes will be displayed in your terminal. The remaining parameters are edited as they would be in an installation: size: Specifies the size of the cluster. Size defines CPU, Memory, Disk, and Replicas. Valid options are: small, medium and large quaypullsecret: quay.io provided with your Sysdig purchase confirmation mail storageClassProvisioner: The name of the storage class provisioner to use when creating the configured storageClassName parameter. When installing, if you use AWS or GKE as your storage provisioner for Kubernetes, enter aws or gke in the storageClassProvisioner field. If you do not use one of those two dynamic storage provisioners, enter: hostPath and then refer to the Advanced examples for how to configure static storage provisioning using this option. sysdig.license: Sysdig license key provided with your Sysdig purchase confirmation mail sysdig.anchoreLicensePath: The path relative to the values.yaml where the Anchore enterprise license yaml is located. (For Sysdig Secure users only.) sysdig.dnsname: The domain name the Sysdig APIs will be served on. Note that the master node may not be used as the DNS name when using hostNetwork mode. sysdig.collector.dnsName: (OpenShift installs only) Domain name the Sysdig collector will be served on. When not configured it defaults to whatever is configured for sysdig.dnsName. Note that the master node may not be used as the DNS name when using hostNetwork mode. deployment : (OpenShift installs only) Add deployment: openshift to the root of the values.yaml file. sysdig.ingressNetworking: The networking construct used to expose the Sysdig API and collector.Options are: hostnetwork: sets the hostnetworking in the ingress daemonset and opens host ports for api and collector. This does not create a Kubernetes service. loadbalancer: creates a service of type loadbalancer and expects that your Kubernetes cluster can provision a load balancer with your cloud provider. nodeport: creates a service of type nodeport.The node ports can be customized with: sysdig.ingressNetworkingInsecureApiNodePort sysdig.ingressNetworkingApiNodePort sysdig.ingressNetworkingCollectorNodePort If doing an airgapped install , you would also edit the following values: (See also Airgapped Installation Options .) airgapped_registry_name: The URL of the airgapped (internal) docker registry. This URL is used for installations where the Kubernetes cluster can not pull images directly from Quay airgapped_registry_password: The password for the configured airgapped_registry_username. Ignore this parameter if the registry does not require authentication. airgapped_registry_username: The username for the configured airgapped_registry_name. Ignore this parameter if the registry does not require authentication. Run the installer. For environments with access to the internet: docker run -e HOST_USER=$(id -u) -e KUBECONFIG=\/.kube\/config \n-v ~\/.kube:\/.kube:Z -v $(pwd):\/manifests:Z \nquay.io\/sysdig\/installer: 3.5.1-1 For partial-airgap (installation machine has access to the internet): docker run -e HOST_USER=$(id -u) -e KUBECONFIG=\/.kube\/config \n -v ~\/.kube:\/.kube:Z \n -v $(pwd):\/manifests:Z \n -v \/var\/run\/docker.sock:\/var\/run\/docker.sock:Z \n -v ~\/.docker:\/root\/docker:Z \n quay.io\/sysdig\/installer: 3.5.1-1 For full airgapped environment: Run steps 1-4 in the Full Airgap Install, then run: bash sysdig_installer.tar.gz If you are fine with the differences displayed, then set scripts to deploy and rerun the installer as in Step 3. If you want to override a change, based on your environment’s custom settings, then contact Sysdig Support for assistance. The datastores Cassandra and ElasticSearch have an onDelete update strategy and must be manually restarted to complete the upgrade. " },

This prevents both unauthorized access to the clusters and network eavesdropping. The upgrade instructions below incorporate this new capability when using the Sysdig-provided Cassandra and Elasticsearch components. If you are running your own Cassandra or Elasticsearch clusters, you can skip the section Elasticsearch and Cassandra Files. Updates of the Postgres database and Anchore engine (if you are running Sysdig Secure). The following parameter has been renamed in config.yaml: elasticsearch.url to elasticsearch.hostname The value of elasticsearch.hostname does not include the protocol (e.g.http:\/\/); just use the hostname itself.

There are different team roles, each of which has read\/write access to different aspects of the app. This limits the exposure of data to those who actually need it, and also makes users more productive by focusing them on data that is relevant to them. The following are some potential use cases for Teams. \"Dev\" vs \"Prod\": Many organizations prefer to limit access to production data. Permits isolating physical infrastructure and the applications on top. Microservices: Scoping data for individual dev teams to see their own dashboards and field their own alerts. Permits team creation based on logical isolation using orchestration or config management metadata in Sysdig Monitor. Platform as a Service: Where Ops teams need to see the entire platform. Enabling certain people to see all data for all services as well as the underlying hardware. This is perfect for managed service providers who are managing a multi-tenant environment, or devops teams using a similar model within their own organization. Restricted environments: Limiting data access for security and compliance. Certain services, such as authentication and billing, may have a very specific set of individuals authorized to access them. Organizations that need to segment monitoring for efficiency: Wide-ranging use case from very large organizations forming teams to simplify access, to smaller orgs creating ephemeral troubleshooting teams, to teams formed to optimize QA and Support access to system data.

See SaaS Regions and IP Ranges for the complete list of reply URLs for different regions. Relay State : Specifies to the application where to redirect the user after authentication is completed. Typically the value is a valid URL for Sysdig. If you are configuring SSO for SaaS, change the relay state to reflect the correct customer number associated with your Sysdig application. For on-prem installations, the customer number is always 1.

A preset that is greater than 10 minutes is refreshed every 1 minute. Select a preset to determine the data sample to be displayed. Overview supports the following presets: 1 Hour: Data polled for the last one hour. This is the default value. 6 Hour: Data polled for the last six-hour. 1 Day: Data polled for the last day. Presets work in conjunction with Range selections. Selecting a particular preset interval refreshes Range selection and reloads the Overview rows and events subsequently. For example: 10 Minutes: Resets the Range to Jul 9, 2.20 pm - Jul 9, 2.30 pm. 6 Hour: Resets the Range to Jul 9, 8.30 am - Jul 9, 2.30 pm. 1 Day: Resets the Range to Jul 8, 2.30 pm - Jul 9, 2.30 pm. Because metrics and events are refreshed every 10 minutes on the Overview page, if you stay for more then 10 minutes on the Overview page, the data will be updated to show the newly-computed values. Presets are global throughout the Sysdig Monitor interface. For example, if you select 10 minutes in the Explore view, the Overview preset will also be 10 minutes, and vice versa. Choosing an unsupported Preset in Explorer falls back to 1 day in Overview. " },

"body" : "Currently, the ratio accounts only for scheduled pods, while pending pods are excluded from the calculation. This means pods have been scheduled to run on Nodes out of the allocatable pods. Consequently, the ratio cannot be higher than 100%. In the case of over-commitment (pods requesting for more resources than what's available), you can expect a higher Requests vs Allocatable ratio and a lower Pods Available vs Desired ratio. What it indicates is that most of the available resources are being used, and what’s left is not enough to schedule additional pods. Therefore, the Available vs Desired ratio for pods will decrease. When your environment has pods that are updated often or that are deleted and created often (for example, testing Clusters), the total requests might appear higher than what it is at any given time. Consequently, the ratio becomes higher across the selected time window, and you might see a value that is higher than 100%. This error is rendered due to how the data engine calculates the aggregated ratio. Drill down to Kubernetes Cluster Overview to see the CPU Cores Usage vs Requests vs Allocatable time series to correctly evaluate the trend of the request commitments. Listed below are some of the factors that could cause the pods to stuck in a Pending state: Pods make requests that exceed what’s available across the nodes (the remaining allocatable pods). The Requests vs Allocatable ratio is an indicator of this issue. Pods make requests that are higher than the availability of every single Node.

"body" : "The ratio currently accounts only for scheduled pods, while pending pods are excluded from the calculation. What this implies is that pods have been scheduled to run on Nodes out of the allocatable resources available. Consequently, the ratio cannot be higher than 100%. In the case of over-commitment (pods requesting for more resources than what's available), expect a higher Requests vs Allocatable ratio and a lower Pods Available vs Desired ratio. What it indicates is that most of the available resources have been used and what’s left is not enough to schedule additional pods. Therefore, the Pods Available vs Desired ratio will decrease. When your environment has pods that are updated often or that are deleted and created often (for example, testing Clusters), the total requests might appear higher than what it is at any given time. Consequently, the ratio becomes higher across the selected time window, and you might see a value that is higher than 100%. This error is rendered due to how the data engine calculates the aggregated ratio. Drill down to Kubernetes Cluster Overview to see the Memory Requests vs Allocatable time series to correctly evaluate the trend for the request commitments. Listed are some of the factors that could cause your pods to stuck in a Pending state: Pods make requests that exceed what’s available across the nodes (the remaining allocatable pods). The Requests vs Allocatable ratio is an indicator of this issue. Pods make requests that are higher than the availability of every single Node. For example, you have 8-core nodes and you create a pod with a 16-core request. These pods might require configuration changes and specific setup related to node affinity and anti-affinity factors. The Quota set at the Namespace-level is reached before a high request is configured. The Requests vs Allocatable ratio might not suggest the problem, but the Pods Available vs Desired ratio would decrease, especially for the specific Namespaces. See the Namespaces screen in Overview.

"body" : "This topic gives insight into the metrics displayed on the Workloads Overview page. Pod Restarts The chart displays the latest value returned by sum(timeAvg(kubernetes.pod.restart.rate)) . What Is It? The sparkline shows the trend of Pod Restarts rate across all the pods in a selected Workload. The number shows the most recent rate, expressed in Restarts per Second. For instance, the image below shows the trend for the last hour. The number indicates that the rate of pod restarts is less than 0.01 for the last 10 minutes. For reference, the sparklines show the following number of steps (sampling): Last hour : 6 steps, each for a 10-minute time slice. Last 6 hours : 12 steps, each for a 20-minute time slice. Last day : 12 steps, each for a 2-hour time slice. What to Expect? A healthy pod will have 0 restarts at any given time. What to Do Otherwise? In most cases, fewer restarts in the last hour (or larger time windows) do not indicate a serious problem. Drill down to the Kubernetes Overview Dashboard related to the Workload in Explore . For example, Kubernetes StatefulSet Overview provides a detailed trend broken down by pods. In this example, the number of restarts is constant (roughly every 5 minutes) and no pods are ready. This might indicate a crash loop back-off . Pods Available vs Desired The chart shows the latest value of returned by sum(avg(kubernetes.deployment.replicas.available)) \/ sum(avg(kubernetes.deployment.replicas.desired)) . What Is It? The chart displays the ratio between available and desired pods, averaged across the selected time window, for all the pods in a given Workload. The upper bound shows the number of desired pods in the Workload. For instance, the image below shows all the 42 desired pods are available. What to Expect? You should typically expect 100%. If certain pods take a significant amount of time to become available (image pull time, pod initialization, readiness probe), then you may temporarily see a ratio lower than 100%. What to Do Otherwise? Determine the Workloads that have low availability by drilling down to the related Dashboard in Explore . For example, the Kubernetes Deployment Overview helps understand the trend and the state of the pods. For instance, the image above shows that the ratio is 98% (3.93 \/ 4 x 100). The slight decline is due to an update that caused pods to be terminated and consequently to be started with a newer version. CPU Used vs Requests The chart shows the latest value returned by sum(avg(cpu.cores.used)) \/ sum(avg(kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.cpuCores)) . Memory Used vs Requests The chart shows the latest value returned by sum(avg(memory.bytes.used)) \/ sum(avg(kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memBytes)) . What Is It? The chart shows the ratio between the total memory usage across all the pods in a Workload and the total memory requested by the Workload. The upper bound shows the total memory requested by all the pods, expressed in the specified unit of bytes. For instance, the image shows that the pods in the selected Workload requested for 120 GiB, of which 24% is actually used (about 29 GiB). What to Expect? The type of Workload determines the ratio. Values between 80% and 120% are considered normal. Values that are higher than 100% is deemed normal if it's observed only for a relatively short time. What to Do Otherwise? A low memory usage indicates that the application is not properly running (not executing the expected functions) or the Workload configuration is not accurate (requests are too high compared to what the pods actually need). A high memory usage indicates that the load is higher for applications or the Workload configuration is not accurate (low requests compared to what the pods actually need). Given the configured limits for the Workloads and the memory pressure on the nodes, if the Workloads use more memory than what’s requested they are at risk of eviction. For more information, see Container's Memory Limit . In either case, drill down to the Workloads page to determine the Workload that requires a deeper analysis. Can the Value Be Higher than 100%? Yes, it can. Configuring memory requests without limits or requests lower than limits is permissible. In these cases, you are allowing the containers to use more resources than requested, typically to handle temporary overloads. Consider a Workload with two containers. Say, one container is configured to request for 1 GiB of memory and uses 1 GiB (Used vs Request ratio is 100%), while the other is configured without any request and uses 1 GiB of memory. In this example, the 2 GiB of memory used to 1 GiB requested ratio is 200% at the Workload level. What Does “No Data” Mean? If the Workload is configured with no memory requests and limits, then the Usage vs Requests ratio cannot be computed. In this case, the chart will show “no data”. Drill down to the Dashboard in Explore to evaluate the actual usage. You must configure requests. It helps to detect Workloads that require reconfiguration. Kubernetes itself might expose Workloads with no requests or limits configured. For example, the kube-system Namespace can have Workloads without requests configured. Network I\/O The chart shows the latest value returned by avg(avg(net.bytes.total)) . What Is It? The sparkline shows the trend of network traffic (inbound and outbound) for the Workload. The number shows the most recent rate, expressed in bytes per second in a specific unit. For reference, the sparklines show the following number of steps (sampling): Last hour : 6 steps, each for a 10-minute time slice Last 6 hours : 12 steps, each for a 30-minute time slice Last day : 12 steps, each for a 2-hour time slice What to Expect? The type of application runs in the Workload determines the metrics. Drill down to the Kubernetes Overview Dashboard corresponding to the Workload in Explore . For example, the Kubernetes Deployment Overview Dashboard provides additional details, such as network activity across pods. " },

"body" : "The Table panel displays metric data in tabular form. In this view, you can review metric values and their associated labels in a single view. Use Table panels for such quantitative analysis where you can see actual values instead of visual representations. Similar to a spreadsheet, you can look at a combination of metric values and their segments. This is useful when you don't necessarily care about the change in metric over time, or want to run reports to download as CSV\/JSON for offline analysis. The panel displays the value returned by the metric query specified in the  Query  tab. The value is determined by the data source and the query. Each datapoint will have an associated raw and an option to add columns for additional metric values. Configuring Table Panel Major features include but not limited to : Queries The first query you build cannot be removed. With subsequent queries are built, you cannot remove all the queries except the first one. Changing the unit of the query changes the unit in the table as well. Changing the display format on the query reflects on the row values. Segmentation The segmentation label determines the column name. The segmentation in conjunction with metric values determines the values displayed on the rows. Scope The selected scope determines the values displayed on the table. Metric \/ Labels Columns Adding a new query insert a new column with the name of the metric as the column heading. Metric values in conjunction with segmentation determine the values displayed on the rows. Sorting Column sorting is based on the selected column header and the type of sorting (ascending and descending). When another column is sorted, the table is resorted by that column, resetting the previous sorting. Resizing Grab the header column by the borderline to resize the columns. Browser window resizes shouldn’t reset the resize of the columns if you have resized any columns. When resizing the browser window, table columns are resized to cover the full width. An exception is when you have already resized columns. In such cases, other columns that you have not resized are resized on browser window resize. The last column in the table is not resizable. Export The table by default shows a maximum of 50 rows. Clicking on Export all results... below the table opens the Export Data window. Export data in either JSON or CVS format to a file. The default name of the file is the panel name. Renaming the default filename is permissible. For information on configuring a chart, see Create a New Panel. " },

"body" : "The Kubernetes * Health dashboards break down resource and performance metrics by various logical entities to allow for an in-depth analysis, and for critical issues to be identified and isolated. Each dashboard is built around the Golden Signals approach to monitoring: Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation. Resource utilization metrics are oriented toward health and performance. These are aspects like CPU, memory, network, and storage usage by Kubernetes object. kube-state-metrics is about the status or count. Pairing kube-state-metrics with resource utilization metrics, each dashboard provides a comprehensive picture of what’s happening in your Kubernetes environment. Dashboard Description Use Cases Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Highlights minimum, maximum, current, and desired replicas. Identify performance bottlenecks. Identify whether there are enough available pods compared to the desired pods. Use usage percentages over time to better estimate expansion capacity. Locate logical entities that are consuming too many cluster resources, or that are rapidly trending upwards towards unsustainable levels. Dive deeper into specific entities to identify the root cause of problems. Use usage percentages over time to better estimate expansion capacity. For example: A deployment with no available pods indicates that the corresponding app is not serving requests. Getting a dashboard on this condition means you can visualize the metrics and spring into action to find and resolve the issue quickly. Dropping the number of pods available and remaining below the desired number indicate that your application performance is degraded or not running at the redundancy required. With these metrics represented on the dashboard, you get a quick glance of the severity of the impact on your app's user experience. A lower number of replicas running during an extended period of time than the number of replicas desired indicates a symptom of entities not working properly, such as nodes or resources unavailability, Kubernetes or Docker Engine failure, broken Docker images, and so on. No replicas for a deployment object could potentially mean that the app is down. A continuous loop of pod restart (CrashLoopBackOff) might be associated with missing dependencies or unmet requirements, or insufficient resources. In CrashLoopBackOff, pods never get into ready status and therefore are counted as unavailable and down. Use these three dashboards to provide a high-level overview of all aspects of the Kubernetes environment's performance and resource saturation status. Set high-level alerts to narrow down areas of concern, before moving to the more in-depth dashboards. Quickly identify major performance issues within each type of entity. Kubernetes Resource Quota Provides an overview of resource limit and request, and the number of replication controllers, services, service ports, service load balancers, configMap, and secrets. Kubernetes Memory Allocation Optimization Highlights Memory allocation optimization. Kubernetes CPU Allocation Optimization Displays CPU utilization of your Kubernetes environment. Kubernetes Cluster Overview Provides an overview of your Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes DaemonSet Overview Overview of DaemonSet objects. Kubernetes Deployment Overview Highlights whether each deployment has a sufficient number of available pods and resources, and indicates the number of pods running, desired, or have been updated. Kubernetes Job Overview Overview of all the jobs and the performance information. Kubernetes Namespace Overview Displays metrics such as resource requests and resource limits at the namespace level; identifies the performance of the Kubernetes entities such as pods, deployments, DaemonSet, Statefulset, and jobs, and compliance with replicaSets specs. Highlights the number of services, deployments, replicaSets, and jobs per namespace. Kubernetes Node Overview Highlights the number of nodes that are ready, unavailable, or out of disk; the number of nodes that are under the memory, disk, or network pressure; compares allocatable capacity with requested capacity on the node; provides the number of pod resources of a node that are available for scheduling and the available capacity to serve the pods running on the nodes. Kubernetes Pod Overview Helps identify potential bottlenecks by graphing the number of container restarts, the number of pods waiting to be scheduled, resource utilization of containers within each pod and available capacity to serve pod requests, the number of available pods compared to the desired pods, and the number of pods in available state and ready to serve requests. Kubernetes ReplicaSet Overview Provides details such as the number of pods per replicaSet, the desired number of pods per replicaSet, and pods per replicaSet that are in a ready state. Kubernetes StatefulSet Overview Overview of the StatefulSet objects in your environment. Kubernetes Cluster and Node Capacity Highlights a comprehensive overview of the performance of the hosts or nodes that form the Kubernetes cluster, including CPU, memory, and file system usage, and network traffic. Before analyzing the Dashboard, consider the following guidelines related to resource usage: If Resource Limits is undefined for a container, Kubernetes does not default to a value. if Resource Requests is unspecified for a container, Kubernetes defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Limits do not default to any value. If both Resource Limits and Resource Requests are not specified, no matter which value had been defaulted by Kubernetes, kube-state-metric (and hence Sysdig Monitor) reports zero. Therefore, only user-defined requested are reported by the kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte metric . The memory used by a container (the value returned by memory.used.bytes) can be greater than the memory requested by a pod (the value returned by kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte) . This is permissible in Kubernetes because Requests value determines the minimum amount of resources required. For these reasons, it can be deduced that In some cases, the value of Used Resources will be more than that of Resource Requests and Resource Limits, and the value of Resource RequestS could be more than that of Resource Limit. The value of kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte <= memory.used.bytes <= kubernetes.pod.resourceLimits.memByte Kubernetes Health Overview Provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of the entire Kubernetes environment, broken down by various logical entities and underlying resource availability and usage. This dashboard breaks down resource and performance kube-state-metrics by the logical Kubernetes entities, such as pods, namespaces, deployments, and replicaSets, containers, and so on. Kubernetes Service Health Displays the count, resource usage, performance, and limitations of services running in the Kuberenetes environment. The dashboard provides and overview of what resources each service is using, their response times, the container and request counts, and how the response times measure up against the resource utilization. Kubernetes Workloads CPU Usage and Allocation Displays resource utilization of your workloads. This dashboard helps you review the CPU usage of your workloads, making sure that the CPU is properly allocated in the Kubernetes environment. All the numbers in this dashboard are expressed in CPU cores. Kubernetes Workloads Memory Usage and Allocation Helps you review the memory usage of your workloads, making sure that the memory is properly allocated in the Kubernetes environment. Kubernetes Service Golden Signals Highlights the latency, traffic, errors, and saturation in your Kubernetes environment. " },

"body" : "Topology View provides an interactive, animated interface to visualize how different components in your system interact with each other in real-time. The interface by default renders a selected host's top processes and their interaction with processes on remote hosts or host groups. Entities in any valid logical grouping can be visually represented with Topology View. The interaction is depicted as nodes and links. Links connect nodes. Nodes and links radially expand from the left. Nodes : The entities participating in network communication. A node could be a process, a container, a host, or any label identified by Sysdig Agent. For example: kubernetes.pod.name. The limit imposed on the maximum number of nodes that can be visualized is as follows: host groups (hosts in a region): 20 hosts: 20 containers: 20 processes: 10 This limit applies to the entities at any node level. Links : The network connection between nodes. Hosts and their child processes ( host.hostName > proc.name) serve as the default grouping for the Topology View. Scaling a Topology View is limited by the number of processes and connections. Sysdig Monitor creates the Topology View by identifying network endpoints (IP addresses) derived from system call data. Topology View in the Explore tab provides pre-defined dashboards to represent CPU Usage , Network Traffic , and Response Time metrics, and as such, they are not configurable. It serves as a template diagnostic tool that provides bottom-up inter-process connection metrics as graphs. For a detailed description on each default metric type supported by the Topology View, see Topology Dashboards . " },

"body" : "The UI allows you to zoom in, zoom out, fit, pan, and reset the display, and expand and collapse the nodes. Zoom into an entity by clicking the associated + icon and view the top processes within the selected entity. You can expand the hosts to see individual processes running inside and corresponding metric value. The links indicating network connections are rendered between entities in the selected hierarchy and, when zoomed, between processes and entities. Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom the content, then left-click and drag to move the map components within the window. Topology View uses legends and color schemes. This section explains what they mean. The line width (thickness) of the links expresses metric values relative to other connections in the system. Scaling line width is relative to the metric values associated with each link. Topology View dynamically adjusts the legend as the data recorded for each connection changes. The thin black line(—): Lower metric values. The thick black line( — ): Higher metric values. Dashed lines(---): A previously existed connection. For example, an active connection between node A and B, rendered as a solid line, could dissolve after a data update if that connection does not exist anymore in the new data set. Instead of removing it from the graph, Sysdig Monitor depicts the inactive connection as a dotted line until the next data update. If the connection returns in a subsequent data update, it is rendered again as a solid line. If the connection does not exist, the line will be removed. The color scheme is determined by color coding for the customizable threshold. The nodes are identified by five colors: Green indicates the node is healthy. Yellow indicates the node is in a warning state. Red indicates the node is in a critical state. Grey indicates the node state is unknown. An unknown node typically signifies a node where no Sysdig Agent installed. Light Blue indicates no threshold is defined for the metrics. " },

"body" : "Sysdig Monitor imports data related to entities such as hosts, containers, processes, and so on, and reports them in tables or panels on the Explore and Dashboards UI, as well as in events, so across the UI you see varieties of data. The term n\/a can appear anywhere on the UI where some form of data is displayed. n\/a is a term that indicates data that is not available or that it does not apply to a particular instance. In Sysdig parlance, the term signifies one or more entities defined by a particular label, such as hostname or Kubernetes service, for which the label is invalid. In other words, n\/a collectively represent entities whose metadata is not relevant to aggregation and filtering techniques—Grouping, Scoping, and Segmenting. For instance, a list of Kubernetes services might display the list of all the services as well as n\/a that includes all the containers without the metadata describing a Kubernetes service. You might encounter n\/a sporadically in Explore UI as well as in drill-down panels or dashboards, events, and likely elsewhere on the Sysdig Monitor UI when no relevant metadata is available for that particular display. How n\/a should be treated depends on the nature of your deployment. The deployment will not be affected by the entities marked n\/a. The following are some of the cases that yield n\/a on the UI: Labels are partially available or not available. For example, a host has entities that are not associated with a monitored Kubernetes deployment, or a monitored host has an unmonitored Kubernetes deployment running. Labels that do not apply to the grouping criteria or at the hierarchy level. For example: Containers that are not managed by Kubernetes. The containers managed by Kubernetes are identified with their  container.name labels. In certain groupings by DaemonSet, Deployments render N\/A and vice versa. Not all containers belong to both DaemonSet and Deployment objects concurrently. Likewise, a Kubernetes ReplicaSet grouping with the  kubernetes.replicaset.name  label will not show StatefulSets. In a  kubernetes.cluster.name > kubernetes.namespace.name > kubernetes.deployment.name  grouping, the entities without the  kubernetes.cluster.name label yield n\/a. Entities are incorrectly labeled in the infrastructure. Kubernetes features that are yet to be in sync with Sysdig Monitoring. The format is not applicable to a particular record in the database.

"body" : "Data can be missing for a few different reasons: Problems such as faulty network connectivity in the communication channel between your infrastructure and Sysdig metrics store. Metrics or StatsD batch jobs are submitted sporadically. Sysdig Monitor allows you to configure the behavior of missing data in Dashboards. Though metric type determines the default behavior, you can configure how to visualize missing data and define it at the per-query level. Use the No Data Display drop-down in the Options menu in the panel configuration. See Create a New Panel for more information. Consider the following guidelines: The No Data Display drop-down has only two options for the Stacked Area timechart: gap and show as zero . For the Number panel, the No Data Display option allows entering a custom no data text. For form-based timechart panels, the default option for a metrics selection that does not contain a StatsD metric is gap . Adding a StatsD metric to a query in a form-based timechart panel will default the selected No Data Display type to the show as zero , which is the default option for form-based StatsD metrics. You can change this selection to any other type. The default display option is gap for PromQL Timechart panels. The options for No Data Display are: gap : The default option for form-based timechart panel, where a query metrics selection does not contain a StatsD metric. gap is the best visualization type for most use cases because it is easy to spot indicating a problem. show as zero : The best option for StatsD metrics which are only submitted sporadically. For example, batch jobs and count of errors. This is the default display option for StatsD metrics in form-based panels. We do not recommend this option as setting zero could be misleading. For example, this setting will report the value for free disk space as 0% when the disk or host disappears, but in reality, the value is unknown. Prometheus best practices recommend avoiding missing metrics. connect - solid : Use for measuring the value of a metric, typically a gauge, where you want to visualize the missing samples flattened. The leftmost and rightmost visible data points can be connected as Sysdig does not perform the interpolation. connect - dotted : Use it for measuring the value of a metric, typically a gauge, where you want to visualize the missing samples flattened.

"body" : "Time aggregation comes into effect in two overlapping situations: Charts can only render a limited number of data points. To look at a wide range of data, Sysdig Monitor may need to aggregate granular data into larger samples for visualization. Sysdig Monitor rolls up historical data over time. Sysdig retains rollups based on each aggregation type, to allow users to choose which data points to utilize when evaluating older data. Sysdig agents collect 1-second samples and report data at 10-second resolution. The data is stored and reported every 10-second with the available aggregations (average, rate, min, max, sum) to make them available via the Sysdig Monitor UI and the API. For time series charts covering five minutes or less, data points are drawn at this 10-second resolution, and any time aggregation selections will have no effect. When an amount of time greater than five minutes is displayed, data points are drawn as an aggregate for an appropriate time interval. For example, for a chart covering one hour, each data point would reflect a one minute interval. At time intervals of one minute and above, charts can be configured to display different aggregates for the 10-second metrics used to calculate each datapoint. Aggregation Type Description average The average of the retrieved metric values across the time period. rate The average value of the metric across the time period evaluated. maximum The highest value during the time period evaluated. minimum The lowest value during the time period evaluated. sum The combined sum of the metric across the time period evaluated. In the example images below, the kubernetes.deployment.replicas.available metrics first uses the average for time aggregation: Then uses the sum for time aggregation: Rate and average are very similar and often provide the same result. However, the calculation of each is different. If time aggregation is set to one minute, the agent is supposed to retrieve six samples (one every 10 seconds). In some cases, samples may not be there, due to disconnections or other circumstances. For this example, four samples are available. If this was the case, the average would be calculated by dividing by four, while the rate would be calculated by dividing by six. Most metrics are sampled once for each time interval, resulting in average and rate returning the same value. However, there will be a distinction for any metrics not reported at every time interval. For example, some custom statsd metrics. Rate is currently referred to as timeAvg in the Sysdig Monitor API and advanced alerting language. By default, average is used when displaying data points for a time interval. " },

If a chart or alert is segmented, the group aggregation settings will be utilized for both aggregations across the whole group, and aggregation within each individual segmentation. For example, the image below shows a chart for CPU% across the infrastructure: When segmented by proc.name , the chart shows one CPU% line for each process: Each line provides the average value for every process with the same name.

For example, a Prometheus metric or some of the Sysdig provided metrics, such as sysdig_container_memory_used_byte . Perform a vector match on container ID with the metric kube_pod_container_info to get the pod metadata. Perform a vector match on the pod, namespace, and cluster with the kube_pod_owner metric. In the case of Sysdig’s extended label set for PromQL, all the metrics inherit the metadata, so that necessary container, host, and Kubernetes metadata are set on all the metrics. This simplifies the query so you can build and run it quickly. Likewise, the above query can be simplified as follows: sum by (kube_cluster_name,kube_namespace_name,kube_deployment_name) (sysdig_container_memory_used_bytes{kube_cluster_name!=\"\",kube_namespace_name!=\"\",kube_deployment_name!=\"\"}) The advantages of using a simplified query are: Complex vector matching operations (the group_left and group_right operators) are no longer required. All the labels are already available on each of the metrics, and therefore, any filtering can be performed directly on the metric itself. The metrics now will have a huge amount of labels. You can use PromQL Explorer to deal with this rich metadata. The metadata is distinguishable from user-defined labels. For example, Kubernetes metadata labels start with kube_ . For instance, cluster is replaced with kube_cluster_name . Create a dashboard panel or an alert from the PromQL query you run in the PromQL Query Explore. Filter data by applying the comparison operators on the label values given in the table. " },

Gauge kubernetes.namespace.name kubernetes.persistentvolumeclaim.label.accessmode kubernetes.persistentvolumeclaim.label.app kubernetes.persistentvolumeclaim.label.status.phase kubernetes.persistentvolumeclaim.label.storage kubernetes.persistentvolumeclaim.label.storageclassname kubernetes.persistentvolumeclaim.label.volumename kubernetes.pod.restart.count The cumulative number of container restarts for the pod over its lifetime. This metric is not useful for alerts. Sysdig recommends using kubernetes.pod.restart.rate instead. Counter - Integer Kubernetes kubernetes.pod.restart.rate The number of container restarts for the pod within the defined scope\/time period. Gauge - Integer Kubernetes kubernetes.replicaSet.replicas.desired The number of replica pods the replicaSet is configured to maintain. Gauge - Integer Kubernetes kubernetes.replicaSet.replicas.running The current number of replica pods running in the replicaSet. Gauge - Integer Kubernetes kubernetes.replicationController.replicas.desired The number of replica pods the replicationController is configured to maintain. Gauge - Integer Kubernetes kubernetes.replicationController.replicas.running The current number of replica pods running in the replication controller. Gauge - Integer Kubernetes " },

"body" : "Steps Description Decide What to monitor Determine what type of problem you want to be alerted on. See Alert Types to choose a type of problem. Define how it will be monitored Specify exactly what behavior triggers a violation. For example, Marathon App is down on the Kubernetes Cluster named Production for ten minutes. Decide Where to monitor Narrow down your environment to receive fine-tuned results. Use Scope to choose an entity that you want to keep a close watch on. Specify additional segments (entities) to give context to the problem. For example, in addition to specifying a Kubernetes cluster, add a namespace and deployment to refine your scope. Define when to notify Define the threshold and time window for assessing the alert condition. Single Alert fires an alert for your entire scope, while Multiple Alert fires if any or every segment breach the threshold at once. Multiple Alerts include all the segments you specified to uniquely identify the location and thus provides a full qualification of where the problem occurred. The higher the number of segments the easier to uniquely identify the affected entities. A good analogy for multiple alerts is alerting on cities. For example, creating multiple alerts on San Francisco would trigger an alert which will include information such as the country that it is part of is the USA and the continent is North America. Trigger gives you control over how notifications are created. For example, you may want to receive a notification for every violation, or want only a single notification for a series of consecutive violations. Decide how notifications are sent Alert supports customizable notification channels, including email, mobile push notifications, OpsGenie, Slack, and more. To see supported services, see Set Up Notification Channels. To create alerts, simply: Choose an alert type . Configure alert parameters . Configure the notification channels you want to use for alert notification. Sysdig sometimes deprecates outdated metrics. Alerts that use these metrics will not be modified or disabled, but will no longer be updated. See Heuristic and Deprecated Metrics. " },

Description (optional): Briefly expand on the alert name or alert condition to give additional context for the recipient. Priority: Select a priority. High , Medium , Low , and Info . You can later sort by the severity by using the top navigation pane. Specify the parameters in the Define , Notify , and Act sections. Define: Based on the alert type, define the parameters. Downtime : Select the entity to monitor. For more information, see Downtime Alert. Metric : Select a metric that this alert will monitor. You also define how the data is aggregated, such as average, maximum, minimum, or sum. Metrics are applied to a group of items (group aggregation). For more information, see Metric Alerts. PromQL : Enter the PromQL query and duration. For more information, see PromQL Alerts. Event : Filter the custom event to be alerted on by using the name, tag, description, and a source tag. For more information, see Event AlertsAnomaly Detection : Specify the metrics to be monitored for anomalies. For more information, see Anomaly Detection Alerts. Group Outlier : Specify the metrics to be monitored for outliers. For more information, see Group Outlier Alerts.

You can use Sysdig in the same way that you use Prometheus and leverage Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) to create dashboards and alerts. Sysdig is compatible with Prometheus HTTP API to query your monitoring data programmatically using PromQL and extend Sysdig to other platforms like Grafana. From a metric collection standpoint, a lightweight Prometheus server is directly embedded into the Sysdig agent to facilitate metric collection. This also supports targets, instances, and jobs with filtering and relabeling using Prometheus syntax. You can configure the agent to identify these processes that expose Prometheus metric endpoints on its own host and send it to the Sysdig collector for storing and further processing. This document uses metric and time series interchangeably. The description of configuration parameters refers to \"metric\", but in strict Prometheus terms, those imply time series. That is, applying a limit of 100 metrics implies applying a limit on time series, where all the time series data might not have the same metric name. The Prometheus product itself does not necessarily have to be installed for Prometheus metrics collection. Sysdig agent v10.5.0: promscrape.v2 that supports Prometheus native service discovery. To support this, a default  prometheus .yaml file has been added with Kubernetes pod discovery rules to use when native Prometheus service discovery is enabled. Sysdig agent v10.0.0 and above: promscrape , a lightweight Prometheus server, by default is used for scraping Prometheus metrics. The component is based on the Open Source Prometheus. Sysdig agent v9.8.0 to v10.0: promscrape , a lightweight Prometheus server, is introduced in v9.8.0 to scrape Prometheus metrics. You must enable promscrape in the dragent.yaml file to use this method. Sysdig agent v0.70.0 and above: Provides rich support for automatically collecting metrics from Prometheus exporters .

"body" : "To use native Prometheus service discovery, enable promscrape.v2 as described in Enable Prometheus Native Service Discovery. This section covers the Sysdig way of service discovery that involves configuring process filters in the Sysdig agent. The way service discovery works in the Sysdig agent differs from that of the Prometheus server . While the Prometheus server has built-in integration with several service discovery mechanisms and the prometheus.yml  file to read the configuration settings from, the Sysdig agent auto-discovers any process (exporter or instrumented) that matches the specifications in the dragent .yaml , file and instructs the embedded lightweight Prometheus server to retrieve the metrics from it. The lightweight Prometheus server in the agent is named promscrape and is controlled by the flag of the same name in the dragent.yaml file. See Configuring Sysdig Agent for more information. Unlike the Prometheus server that can scrape processes running on all the machines in a cluster, the agent can scrape only those processes that are running on the host that it is installed on. Within the set of eligible processes\/ports\/endpoints, the agent scrapes only the ports that are exporting Prometheus metrics and will stop attempting to scrape or retry on ports based on how they respond to attempts to connect and scrape them. It is therefore strongly recommended that you create a configuration that restricts the process and ports for attempted scraping to the minimum expected range for your exporters. This minimizes the potential for unintended side-effects in both the Agent and your applications due to repeated failed connection attempts. The end to end metric collection can be summarized as follows: A process is determined to be eligible for possible scraping if it positively matches against a series of Process Filter include\/exclude rules. See Process Filter for more information. The Agent will then attempt to scrape an eligible process at a \/metrics endpoint on all of its listening TCP ports unless the additional configuration is present to restrict scraping to a subset of ports and\/or another endpoint name. As of agent v9.8.0, filtering metrics at ingestion can be enabled. If enabled, filtering rules are applied at ingestion as it receives the metrics. See Filtering Prometheus Metrics for more information. Upon receiving the metrics, the agent applies the following rules before sending them to the Sysdig collector. Applies the global metrics_filter rules. See Include\/Exclude Custom Metrics. Imposes the configured max_metrics to limit the number of metrics. See Enforcing Limit on Prometheus Metric Collection. The metrics ultimately appear in the Sysdig Monitor Explore interface in the Prometheus section. " },

If an exporter is using a different endpoint, this can also be specified by adding the following additional optional Annotation, substituting the exporter-endpoint-name : \nprometheus.io\/path: \"\/exporter-endpoint-name\" If you try this Kubernetes Deployment of a simple exporter , you will quickly see auto-discovered Prometheus metrics being displayed in Sysdig Monitor.

Note that once you specify a process_filter in your dragent.yaml , this replaces the entire Prometheus process_filter section (i.e. all the rules) shown in the dragent.default.yaml . The Process Filter is specified in a series of include and exclude rules that are evaluated top-to-bottom for each process known by an Agent. If a process matches an include rule, scraping will be attempted via a \/metrics endpoint on each listening TCP port for the process, unless a conf section also appears within the rule to further restrict how the process will be scraped (see conf below).

Note that due to YAML syntax, when using wildcards, be sure to enclose the value in quotes ( \"*\" ). The table below describes the supported patterns in Process Filter rules.

Pattern name Description Example container.image Matches if the process is running inside a container running the specified image - include: container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app container.name Matches if the process is running inside a container with the specified name - include: container.name : my-java-app container.label.* Matches if the process is running in a container that has a Label matching the given value - include: container.label.class: exporter kubernetes.<object>.annotation.* kubernetes.<object>.label.* Matches if the process is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with the Annotation\/Label matching the given value. Note: This pattern does not apply to the Docker-only command-line shown above, but would instead apply if the exporter were installed as a Kubernetes Deployment using this example YAML . Note: See Kubernetes Objects, below, for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. - include: kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape : true process.name Matches the name of the running process - include: process.name : java process.cmdline Matches a command line argument - include: process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\" port Matches if the process is listening on one or more TCP ports. The pattern for a single rule can specify a single port as shown in this example, or a single range (e.g. 8079-8081 ), but does not support comma-separated lists of ports\/ranges. Note: This parameter is only used to confirm if a process is eligible for scraping based on the ports on which it is listening. For example, if a process is listening on one port for application traffic and has a second port open for exporting Prometheus metrics, it would be possible to specify the application port here (but not the exporting port), and the exporting port in the conf section (but not the application port), and the process would be matched as eligible and the exporting port would be scraped. - include: port: 8080 appcheck.match Matches if an Application Check with the specific name or pattern is scheduled to run for the process. - exclude: appcheck.match: \"*\" Instead of the include examples shown above that would have each matched our process, due to the previously-described ability to combine multiple patterns in a single rule, the following very strict configuration would also have matched: - include:\n container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n container.name: my-java-app\n container.label.class: exporter\n process.name: java\n process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\"\n port: 8080 " },

Once enabled, this default configuration is ideal for the use case described in the Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments. A Process Filter rule excludes processes that are likely to exist in most environments but are known to never export Prometheus metrics, such as the Docker Proxy and the Agent itself. Another Process Filter rule ensures that any processes configured to be scraped by the legacy Prometheus application check will not be scraped. Another Process Filter rule is tailored to use container Labels. Processes marked with the container Label io.prometheus.scrape will become eligible for scraping, and if further marked with container Labels io.prometheus.port and\/or io.prometheus.path , scraping will be attempted only on this port and\/or endpoint. If the container is not marked with the specified path Label, scraping the \/metrics endpoint will be attempted. If the container is not marked with the specified port Label, any listening ports in the port_filter will be attempted for scraping (this port_filter in the default is set for the range of ports for common Prometheus exporters , with exclusions for ports in the range that are known to be used by other applications that are not exporters).

"body" : "Multiple Agents can share the same configuration. Therefore, determine which one of those Agents scrape the remote endpoints with the dragent.yaml file. This is applicable to both Create a separate configuration section for remote services in the Agent configuration file under the prometheus configuration. Include a configuration section for each remote endpoint, and add either a URL or host\/port (and an optional path) parameter to each section to identify the endpoint to scrape. The optional path identifies the resource at the endpoint. An empty path parameter defaults to the \"\/metrics\" endpoint for scraping. Optionally, add custom tags for each endpoint configuration for remote services. In the absence of tags, metric reporting might not work as expected when multiple endpoints are involved. Agents cannot distinguish similar metrics scraped from multiple endpoints unless those metrics are uniquely identified by tags. To help you get started, an example configuration for Kubernetes is given below: prometheus:\n remote_services:\n - prom_1:\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/region: europe\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/scraper: true\n conf:\n url: \"https:\/\/xx.xxx.xxx.xy:5005\/metrics\"\n tags:\n host: xx.xxx.xxx.xy\n service: prom_1\n scraping_node: \"{kubernetes.node.name}\"\n - prom_2:\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/region: india\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/scraper: true\n conf:\n host: xx.xxx.xxx.yx\n port: 5005\n use_https: true\n tags:\n host: xx.xxx.xxx.yx\n service: prom_2\n scraping_node: \"{kubernetes.node.name}\"\n - prom_3:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.sysdig.com\/prom_3_scraper: true\n conf:\n url: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.sysdig.com\/prom_3_url}\"\n tags:\n service: prom_3\n scraping_node: \"{kubernetes.node.name}\"\n - haproxy:\n kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_scraper: true\n conf:\n host: \"mymasternode\"\n port: 1936\n path: \"\/metrics\"\n username: \"{kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_username}\"\n password: \"{kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_password}\"\n tags:\n service: router In the above example, scraping is triggered by node and pod annotations. You can add annotations to nodes and pods by using the kubectl annotate command as follows: \nkubectl annotate node mynode --overwrite sysdig.com\/region=india sysdig.com\/scraper=true haproxy_scraper=true yourhost.com\/haproxy_username=admin yourhost.com\/haproxy_password=admin In this example, you set annotation on a node to trigger scraping of the prom2 and haproxy services as defined in the above configuration.

The authentication methods for local scraping works for authenticating agents on remote hosts as well, but the authorization parameters work only in the agent context. Authentication based on certificate-key pair requires it to be constructed into Kubernetes secret and mounted to the agent. In token-based authentication, make sure the agent token has access rights on the remote endpoint to do the scraping. Use annotation to retrieve username\/password instead of passing them in plaintext. Any annotation enclosed in curly braces will be replaced by the value of the annotation. If the annotation doesn't exist the value will be an empty string. Token substitution is supported for all the authorization parameters. Because authorization works only in the Agent context, credentials cannot be automatically retrieved from the target pod. Therefore, use an annotation in the Agent pod to pass them.

"body" : "In infrastructures already containing a third party StatsD collection server, StatsD metrics can be collected \"out of band\". A passive collection technique is automatically performed by our agent by intercepting system calls - as is done for all the Sysdig Monitor metrics normally collected. This method does not require changing your current StatsD configuration and is an excellent way to 'test drive' the Sysdig Monitor application without having to perform any modifications other than agent installation. The passive mode of collection is especially suitable for containerized environments where simplicity and efficiency are essential. With the containerized version of the Sysdig Monitor agent running on the host, all other container applications can continue to transmit to any currently implemented collector. In the case where no collector exists, container applications can simply be configured to send StatsD metrics to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1) as demonstrated above - no actual StatsD server needs to be listening at that address. Effectively, each network transmission made from inside the application container, including statsd messages sent to a non existent destination, generates a system call. The Sysdig agent captures these system calls from its own container, where the statsd collector is listening. In practice, the Sysdig agent acts as a transparent proxy between the application and the StatsD collector, even if they are in different containers. The agent correlates which container a system call is coming from, and uses that information to transparently label the StatsD messages. The above graphic demonstrates the components of the Sysdig agent and where metrics are actively or passively collected. Regardless of the method of collection, the number of StatsD metrics the agent can transmit is limited by your payment plan. Note 1 : When using the passive technique, ICMP port unreachable events may be generated on the host network. Note 2: Some clients may use IPv6 addressing (::1) for the \"localhost\" address string. Metrics collection over IPv6 is not supported at this time. If your StatsD metrics are not visible in the Sysdig Monitor interface, please use \"127.0.0.1\" instead of \"localhost\" string to force IPv4. Another solution that may be required is adding the JVM option: java.net .preferIPv4Stack=true. Note 3 : When StatsD metrics are not continuously transmitted by your application (once per second as in the case of all agent created metrics), the charts will render a 'zero' or null value. Any alert conditions will only look at those Statsd values actually transmitted and ignore the nulls. For more detail on the benefits of Sysdig Monitor's implementation of StatsD, please see the article State of the Art: StatsD Deployment Strategies in Containerized Environments . " },

"body" : "The Sysdig agent can reliably receive StatsD metrics from containers, even while the agent is under load. This setting is controlled by the use_forwarder configuration parameter. The Sysdig agent automatically parses and records StatsD metrics. Historically, the agent parsed the system call stream from the kernel in order to read and record StatsD metrics from containers. For performance reasons, the agent may not be able to collect all StatsD metrics using this mechanism if the load is high. For example, if the StatsD client writes more than 2kB worth of StatsD metrics in a single system call, the agent will truncate the StatsD message, resulting in loss of StatsD metrics. With the introduction of the togglable use_forwarder option, the agent can collect StastsD metrics even under high load. This feature is introduced in Sysdig agent v0.90.1. As of agent v10.4.0, the configuration is enabled by default. statsd:\n use_forwarder: true To disable, set it to false: statsd:\n use_forwarder: false When enabled, rather than use the system call stream for container StatsD messages, the agent listens for UDP datagrams on the configured StatsD port on the localhost within the container's network namespace. This enables the agent to reliably receive StatsD metrics from containers, even while the agent is under load. This option introduces a behavior change in the agent, both in the destination address and in port settings. When the option is disabled, the agent reads StatsD metrics that are destined to any remote address. With the option is enabled, the agent receives only those metrics that are addressed to the localhost. When the option is disabled, the agent reads the container StatsD messages destined to only port 8125. When the option is enabled, the agent uses the configured StatsD port. " },

The latest version of Falco.  The sysdig-sdk-python  wrappers that deploy the rule files to a Sysdig platform deployment. The image is tagged with new versions as new sets of rules files are released, and the  latest  tag is always pointed to the latest version.

Sysdig agents capture process, network, system and other infrastructure data with a 1-second resolution, and sends them to the Sysdig worker service with a 10-second resolution. The data API allows you to fetch data at the native resolution of 10-second or lower. You can specify the resolution to return data via the sampling parameter. Each resolution has different data retention periods. Since native data capturing is performed with a 1-second resolution, for each metric you need to specify a time aggregation . Similarly, data associated with individual pods, processes, and so can be aggregated at a higher level. For example, at the host or namespace level. This type of aggregation depends on the list of labels you specify. For instance, you could aggregate data at the host level by specifying a host label. For this to work, you need to specify a group aggregation . To learn more about data aggregation, see Data Aggregation. " },

"body" : "Database access is protected with a data rate limit. When the limit is hit, any access to account data is prevented for 15 seconds. Any user of the account won’t be able to access data via API or UI. However, Alerts will not be impacted by the data rate limit. To overcome this limitation, reduce the amount of data to be downloaded at a time from the database. For example, instead of creating two separate requests for two metrics, create a single request to get both the metrics. Use container labels or host labels instead of Kubernetes labels. This prevents all the Kubernetes labels and metrics to be loaded from the database, which is resource-intensive. When necessary, break down requests into node “chunks” and do not make all requests at the same time. For example: kubernetes.cluster.name \/ agent.cluster.name kubernetes.node.name \/ host.hostName agent.id When necessary, specify filters using labels that optimize database access (via indexing). By default, the following labels can be used: agent.id container.image container.image.repo container.image.tag kubernetes.cluster.name kubernetes.namespace.name kubernetes.node.name kubernetes.replicationController.name kubernetes.service.name kubernetes.deployment.name kubernetes.daemonSet.name kubernetes.replicaSet.name kubernetes.statefulSet.name kubernetes.resourcequota.name host.domain host.hostName host.ip.private host.ip.public host.mac If you need to periodically pull data, avoid overlapping requests over time. This will avoid downloading the same data more than once. Use either the Timeline API or get the latest, and calculate older time windows. When necessary, break down requests into multiple time windows. Don't make all requests at the same time. " },

"body" : "The \"container-as-a-service\" serverless environment calls for new agent models, and Sysdig provides them. Whereas in ECS, users still manage the underlying instances, with AWS Fargate the host is never visible and users simply run their workloads. And while this model is convenient, it can introduce risk as many people leave the containers unattended, without monitoring security events within that can exfiltrate secrets, compromise business data, impact performance, and increase their AWS costs. In addition, it is not possible to install a standard agent in an environment where you do not have access to a host. For these reasons, Sysdig has introduced a new “serverless agent” model that can be deployed in these container-based cloud environments. The first implementation is for Fargate (ECS). Sysdig will be rolling out security features on the serverless agent over time. In v1.0.0, users will see: Runtime Policies and Rules Secure Events To obtain secure event information and the associated Falco policies and rules in the Sysdig Secure UI from a Fargate environment, users install the serverless agent using a CloudFormation Template. Then log in to Sysdig Secure and review the events in the UI. See also: AWS Fargate Serverless Agents and Serverless Agent Release Notes (for future updates). " },

It also provides the first line of defense against image-based security threats. By using Kubernetes API extensions to perform image scanning and other security checks on admission, we cover a major threat-prevention and hardening use case:  “Only the images that are explicitly approved will be allowed to run on my cluster” . The admission decision relies not only on the image name and tag but also on additional context from the admission review, including namespace, pod metadata, etc. Features Registry and repository whitelist \/ blacklist Global and per-namespace admission configuration Configurable pre-scan and post-scan behavior, i.e.: Accept only the images that pass the scan (default) Directly reject non-whitelisted registries \/ repos, without scanning Accept the image even if it doesn’t pass the scan Do not accept any image that hasn’t been scanned already Pod mutation: image tag is replaced by digest to prevent TOCTOU (Time of Check, Time of Use) issue if the tag is updated between the scan and the pod scheduling Requirements Helm 3 Kubernetes 1.15 or higher " },

Audit takes the highly detailed data from syscalls and Kubernetes audit logs captured at the agent level, and makes it always-on, searchable, and indexed against your cloud-native assets. This stream includes executed commands, network activity, and kubectl exec requests to the Kubernetes API. The Activity Audit allows users to view different data sources in-depth for monitoring, troubleshooting, diagnostics, or to meet regulatory controls (SOC2, NIST, PCI, etc). Flexible filtering and scoping to help you focus on what’s relevant: Filters allow you to search, sort, and surface meaningful data and connections as they are needed. You can filter by data source type, data source attributes (like command name or Kubernetes user) and dynamic Kubernetes scope Automatically trace a kubectl exec session : The built-in trace functionality allows you to isolate and trace a kubectl exec access to a pod, automatically correlating the original Kubernetes user and IP that accessed the pod with the activity that was performed during the interactive session, including commands and network connections.

"body" : "With the Kubernetes Policy Advisor, Sysdig Secure auto-generates Pod Security Policies (PSPs) to significantly decrease the time spent configuring Kubernetes Policies. Strict security policies reduce risk, but can also break applications. Sysdig tests the impact of pod security policies through simulations, enabling teams to adjust misconfigurations before shifting to production. There are three main features that comprise the Kubernetes Policy Advisor: Auto generation: Sysdig Secure can parse any Kubernetes yaml file that includes a pod spec to generate a tailor-made PSP based on the configuration. Simulations: Start a simulation of the auto-generated PSP or any user-inputted PSP to see what pods would have been blocked from running if this PSP had been actively applied to the cluster. Events and tuning: Each pod\/activity that would have violated the PSP will generate an event. Within the event details, users can see information about potential modifications they may need to make to the policy or the pod configuration. " },

Fix for Kubernetes delegation error Fixed an issue that caused Kubernetes delegation to not work after the cointerface process restarts following a crash. Fix for accounting Network errors Network-related errors are now correctly accounted for instead of being treated as file-open errors. New Prometheus Client Version Updated  prometheus_client  to version 0.7.1. This should result in improved performance while ingesting Prometheus metrics. Fix for dropping StatsD Metrics A defect in earlier versions of Sysdig Monitor with the statsd.use_forwarder option could drop some StatsD metrics from containers. This change resolves that problem; the agent will begin fetching metrics from containers 10 seconds after first identifying that the container exists. The 10 second delay allows containers to start StatsD servers within their network namespaces if they choose. The timeout can be overridden using the statsd.container_server_creation_delay_s option, which specifies the delay in seconds.

Fixed limit\/requests calculations for init containers Fixed memory calculations for Kubernetes init container limits and requests Improved Healthcheck monitoring Agent has improved ability to detect commands identified as a part of Kubernetes Liveness\/Readiness Probes, in addition to Docker Health Checks. Improved error messaging Warning messages for container group inconsistencies were demoted to debug level, as they are harmless and do not need to clutter the error reporting stream. Fixed issue with container \"incomplete\" reporting status Starting with version 0.90.0, the agent would report containers for which it had not yet fetched metadata as \"incomplete.\" This would then propagate to the Monitor UI. This restores the behavior where the agent leaves the unknown fields unset. Resolved REST server issue Fixed problem where an enabled port would respond to HTTP requests when not desired. Fixed issue with StatsD metrics collection Previous versions of the Sysdig agent, when configured to use the StatsD fowarder ( {{statsd.use_forwarder: true}} ) truncated messages that it received from containers to 2048 bytes, resulting in the potential for dropped and corrupted metrics.

Flexible filtering and scoping to help you focus on what’s relevant: Filters allow you to search, sort, and surface meaningful data and connections as they are needed. You can filter by data source type, data source attributes (like command name or Kubernetes user) and dynamic Kubernetes scope Automatically trace a kubectl exec session : The built-in trace functionality allows you to isolate and trace a kubectl exec access to a pod, automatically correlating the original Kubernetes user and IP that accessed the pod with the activity that was performed during the interactive session, including commands and network connections.

Strict security policies reduce risk, but can also break applications. Sysdig tests the impact of pod security policies through simulations, enabling teams to adjust misconfigurations before shifting to production. There are three main features that comprise the Kubernetes Policy Advisor: Auto generation: Sysdig Secure can parse any Kubernetes yaml file that includes a pod spec to generate a tailor-made PSP based on the configuration. Simulations: Start a simulation of the auto-generated PSP or any user-inputted PSP to see what pods would have been blocked from running if this PSP had been actively applied to the cluster. Events and tuning: Each pod\/activity that would have violated the PSP will generate an event. Within the event details, users can see information about potential modifications they may need to make to the policy or the pod configuration. " },

Rule Changes Add a new rule, Outbound Connection to C2 Servers, to the Disallowed Network Activity policy. 0.10.1 September 30, 2020 Rule Changes Write below root : Similar to the rules that rely on a process name for exceptions, events will not be triggered if the process name is missing. For example, \"\" . Delete or rename shell history. Ignore docker programs that would prevent modifying shell history, when the path is expressed within the container filesystem ( \/.bash_history ) and host filesystem ( \/var\/lib\/docker\/overlay\/...\/.bash_history ). All Rules: Changes to the tags to add NIST 800-53 and SOC2 tags: Renamed previous NIST 800-190 tags to use the prefix NIST_800-190_ .

"body" : "Cassandra is used as the metrics store for Sysdig agents. It is the most dynamic component of the system, and requires additional attention to ensure that your system is performing well and highly responsive. This component is stateful, and should be treated more carefully than stateless components. Cassandra sizing is based on a minimum replication factor as well as the number of agents writing data. A minimum replication factor of 3 is recommended for the Sysdig application, which allows the cluster to survive the failure of 1 Cassandra instance. Each agent consumes anywhere from 500MB to 2GB of Cassandra storage, with average sizing at 1.5GB\/agent. Because of Sysdig's data aggregation model, this storage should comfortably handle multi-year history. This needs to then be multiplied by the replication factor to determine the total disk space required. A rough calculation might be: 100 agents = 150GB raw, X replication factor of 3, = 450GB total To be safe we recommend that you size some additional disk space as buffer (say 25-50%) on top of that.

The Sysdig platform includes both Sysdig Monitor and Sysdig Secure, which are licensed separately. All installations include Sysdig Monitor, while some of the Secure components are installed and configured as additional steps, as noted. When installing the Sysdig platform with Kubernetes as the orchestrator, you install each backend component with separate kubectl commands.

See Oversight Services Now Offered for All Installs and Upgrades . For customers, the instructions in this section are for review purposes only. The Installer tool can be used to upgrade a Sysdig implementation. Just as in an installation, you must meet the prerequisites, download the values.yaml , edit the values as indicated, and run the installer. The main difference is that you run it twice: once to discover the differences between the old and new versions and the second time to deploy the new version. As this is a new feature, some guidance from Sysdig Professional Services may be warranted in highly customized installations. Upgrade Steps To upgrade: Download the latest installer binary that matches your OS from the sysdigcloud-kubernetes releases page. Copy the current version of values.yaml to your working directory. wget https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/draios\/sysdigcloud-kubernetes\/installer\/installer\/values.yaml Edit the following values: scripts : set to generate diff. This setting will generate the differences between the installed environment and the upgrade version. The changes will be displayed in your terminal. The remaining parameters are edited as they would be in an installation: size: Specifies the size of the cluster. Size defines CPU, Memory, Disk, and Replicas. Valid options are: small, medium and large quaypullsecret: quay.io provided with your Sysdig purchase confirmation mail storageClassProvisioner: The name of the storage class provisioner to use when creating the configured storageClassName parameter. When installing, if you use AWS or GKE as your storage provisioner for Kubernetes, enter aws or gke in the storageClassProvisioner field. If you do not use one of those two dynamic storage provisioners, enter: hostPath and then refer to the Advanced examples for how to configure static storage provisioning using this option. sysdig.license: Sysdig license key provided with your Sysdig purchase confirmation mail sysdig.anchoreLicensePath: The path relative to the values.yaml where the Anchore enterprise license yaml is located. (For Sysdig Secure users only.) sysdig.dnsname: The domain name the Sysdig APIs will be served on. Note that the master node may not be used as the DNS name when using hostNetwork mode. sysdig.collector.dnsName: (OpenShift installs only) Domain name the Sysdig collector will be served on. When not configured it defaults to whatever is configured for sysdig.dnsName. Note that the master node may not be used as the DNS name when using hostNetwork mode. deployment : (OpenShift installs only) Add deployment: openshift to the root of the values.yaml file. sysdig.ingressNetworking: The networking construct used to expose the Sysdig API and collector.Options are: hostnetwork: sets the hostnetworking in the ingress daemonset and opens host ports for api and collector. This does not create a Kubernetes service. loadbalancer: creates a service of type loadbalancer and expects that your Kubernetes cluster can provision a load balancer with your cloud provider. nodeport: creates a service of type nodeport.The node ports can be customized with: sysdig.ingressNetworkingInsecureApiNodePort sysdig.ingressNetworkingApiNodePort sysdig.ingressNetworkingCollectorNodePort If doing an airgapped install , you would also edit the following values: airgapped_registry_name: The URL of the airgapped (internal) docker registry. This URL is used for installations where the Kubernetes cluster can not pull images directly from Quay airgapped_registry_password: The password for the configured airgapped_registry_username. Ignore this parameter if the registry does not require authentication. airgapped_registry_username: The username for the configured airgapped_registry_name. Ignore this parameter if the registry does not require authentication. Run the installer. For environments with access to the internet: docker run -e HOST_USER=$(id -u) -e KUBECONFIG=\/.kube\/config \n-v ~\/.kube:\/.kube:Z -v $(pwd):\/manifests:Z \nquay.io\/sysdig\/installer:<version> For other supported installer versions, see Supported Installer Versions. For partial-airgap (installation machine has access to the internet): docker run -e HOST_USER=$(id -u) -e KUBECONFIG=\/.kube\/config \n -v ~\/.kube:\/.kube:Z \n -v $(pwd):\/manifests:Z \n -v \/var\/run\/docker.sock:\/var\/run\/docker.sock:Z \n -v ~\/.docker:\/root\/docker:Z \n quay.io\/sysdig\/installer:<version> For other supported installer versions, see Supported Installer Versions. For full airgapped environment: Run steps 1-4 in the Full Airgap Install , then run: bash sysdig_installer.tar.gz If you are fine with the differences displayed, then set scripts to deploy and rerun the installer as in Step 3. If you want to override a change, based on your environment’s custom settings, then contact Sysdig Support for assistance. The datastores Cassandra and ElasticSearch have an onDelete update strategy and must be manually restarted to complete the upgrade. " },

This prevents both unauthorized access to the clusters and network eavesdropping. The upgrade instructions below incorporate this new capability when using the Sysdig-provided Cassandra and Elasticsearch components. If you are running your own Cassandra or Elasticsearch clusters, you can skip the section Elasticsearch and Cassandra Files. Updates of the Postgres database and Anchore engine (if you are running Sysdig Secure).
