As part of the agent installation Welcome Wizard, you are prompted to create a user ID (based on email address) and password, which become the core Admin credentials. Once agent installation is complete, the Sysdig Monitor interface is available at https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com . Subsequent users must also have user credentials defined, either through Sysdig Monitor or through an integrated authentication tool. For information on creating users, see User and Team Administration . The Sysdig Monitor Interface The Explore module is the primary starting point for all troubleshooting with Sysdig Monitor, and the default homepage of the web interface for all users. An overview of the health of the entire infrastructure is displayed in a table, with various infrastructure components broken into a pre-configured hierarchical grouping. Groupings are hierarchical aggregations that allow users to break down their infrastructure into logical sections to find and view issues. The default out-of-the-box grouping is host.hostName → container.name . For more information on groupings, refer to the Grouping, Scoping, and Segmenting Metrics section. The left-side menu provides access to the five primary modules within Sysdig Monitor, in addition to user menus and Spotlight. Module Description Explore The Explore module provides users with an in-depth overview of the entire infrastructure, and the ability to deep dive into metrics and dashboards to troubleshoot issues. Dashboards The Dashboards module allows users to create, modify, and share dashboards. For more information, refer to the Dashboards documentation. Alerts The Alerts module allows users to create, modify, and enable\/disable the current alerts configured in Sysdig Monitor, to ensure infrastructure issues are identified effectively. For more information, refer to the Alerts documentation. Events The Events module provides a detailed list of any events that triggered an alert within the infrastructure. For more information, refer to the Events documentation. Captures The Captures page provides a complete list of any capture files that have been created within Sysdig Monitor. For more information, refer to the Captures documentation. " },

"body" : "Because custom metrics and their labels can grow to millions of entries, they are indexed by the system, and a \"metrics lifecycle\" is imposed on them and their labels. This improves performance and prevents cluttering the system with short-lived container or metric names. Sysdig Monitor maintains an index of all custom metrics and custom labels that have reported data in the last 14 days. Each indexed metric\/label is available when configuring new or existing artifacts (i.e. dashboards, scopes, alerts etc). When the system does not receive any data for a metric\/label for more than 14 days, or a metric\/label is found that has never reported data (for example, it was never added to the metric index), it is removed from the index if present, and marked as missing . Missing metrics are different to instances where a panel\/dashboard states that \" Metric data is not available \". A missing metric\/label is still available for data queries and charts. Existing artifacts are not affected. However, it is not possible to configure new artifacts with a missing metric\/label, or to update existing artifacts unless the missing metrics\/labels are removed from the configuration. If new data is received for a missing metric\/label, we put it back into the index and the above limitations are removed. What You See in the UI: If you configured a dashboard three months ago and a metric in it is now missing, when you go to the dashboard and update it in the dashboard settings, a warning appears below the metric stating that the metric is missing. To be able to update the dashboard, you must remove all missing metrics from it.

"body" : " Time Aggregation Group Aggregation Aggregation Examples Time Aggregation Time aggregation comes into effect in two overlapping situations: Charts can only render a limited number of data points. To look at a wide range of data, Sysdig Monitor may need to aggregate granular data into larger samples for visualization. Sysdig Monitor rolls up historical data over time. Sysdig retains rollups based on each aggregation type, to allow users to choose which datapoints to utilize when evaluating older data. By default, Sysdig agents collect and report metrics at a 10 second resolution. For time series charts covering five minutes or less, datapoints are drawn at this 10 second resolution, and any time aggregation selections will have no effect. When an amount of time greater than five minutes is displayed, data points are drawn as an aggregate for an appropriate time interval. For example, for a chart covering one hour, each datapoint would reflect a one minute interval. At time intervals of one minute and above, charts can be configured to display different aggregates for the 10 second metrics used to calculate each datapoint. Aggregation Type Description average The average of the retrieved metric values across the time period. rate The average value of the metric across the time period evaluated. maximum The highest value during the time period evaluated. minimum The lowest value during the time period evaluated. sum The combined sum of the metric across the time period evaluated. In the example images below, the kubernetes.deployment.replicas.available metrics first uses the average for time aggregation, and then uses the sum for time aggregation: Rate and average are very similar, and often provide the same result. However, the calculation of each is different. If time aggregation is set to one minute, the agent is supposed to retrieve six samples (one every 10 seconds). In some cases, samples may not be there, due to disconnections or other circumstances. For this example, four samples are available. If this was the case, the average would be calculated by dividing by four, while the rate would be calculated by dividing by six. Most metrics are sampled once for each time interval, resulting in average and rate returning the same value. However, there will be a distinction for any metrics not reported at every time interval (for example, some custom statsd metrics). Rate is currently referred to as timeAvg in the Sysdig Monitor API and advanced alerting language. By default, average is used when displaying datapoints for a time interval. Group Aggregation Metrics applied to a group of items (for example, several containers, hosts, or nodes) are averaged between the members of the group by default. For example, three hosts report different CPU usage for one sample interval. The three values will be averaged, and reported on the chart as a single datapoint for that metric. There are several different types of group aggregation: Aggregation Type Description average The average value of the interval's samples. maximum The maximum value of the interval's samples. minimum The minimum value of the interval's samples. sum The combined value of all of the interval's samples. If a chart or alert is segmented, the group aggregation settings will be utilized for both aggregation across the whole group, and aggregation within each individual segmentation. For example, the image below shows a chart for CPU% across the infrastructure: When segmented by proc.name , the chart shows one CPU% line for each process: Each line provides the average value for every process with the same name. To see the difference, change the group aggregation type to sum: The metric aggregation value showed beside the metric name is for the time aggregation. While the screenshot shows AVG , the group aggregation is set to SUM . Aggregation Examples The tables below provide an example of how each type of aggregation works. The first table provides the metric data, while the second displays the resulting value for each type of aggregation. In the example below, the CPU% metric is applied to a group of servers called webserver . The first chart shows metrics using average aggregation for both time and group. The second chart shows the metrics using maximum aggregation for both time and group. For each one minute interval, the second chart renders the highest CPU usage value found from the servers in the webserver group and from all of the samples reported during the one minute interval. This view can be useful when searching for transient spikes in metrics over long periods of time, that would otherwise be missed with average aggregation. The group aggregation type is dependent on the segmentation. For a view showing metrics for a group of items, the current group aggregation setting will revert to the default setting, if the Segment By selection is changed. " },

"body" : "Containers The CPU usage for each container is obtained from cgroups, and normalized by dividing by the number of cores to determine an overall percentage. For example, if the environment contains six cores on a host, and the container or processes are assigned two cores, Sysdig will report CPU usage as: 2\/6 * 100% = 33.33% By comparison, the docker stats command would report the CPU usage as 200%, as each individual core is assigned a value of 100%. For service or orchestrator constructs, the container CPU is aggregated based on container labels. Hosts The CPU usage for each host is obtained from \/proc, and measured as the sum of the CPU usage of all cores, normalized by dividing by the number of cores. The CPU usage for each host is the sum of cpu.user.percent, cpu.nice.percent, cpu.stolen.percent, and cpu.system.percent. The Linux command top can be used to review these values as well. Processes The CPU usage for each process is obtained from \/proc, and normalized by dividing by the number of cores. When cpu.used.percent is segmented by process at the host level, the sum of the CPU usage of each process may not always add up to the CPU usage of the host. The most common reasons for this are: There are short-lived processes that spike for less than two seconds. Granular data is retained for the highest CPU usage processes, rather than all processes. The kernel thread CPU usage is not reported as a process.

"body" : "The Sysdig agent retrieves data from your Java virtual machines using the JMX protocol. The agent is configured to automatically discover active Java virtual machines and poll them for basic JVM metrics like Heap Memory and Garbage collector as well as application specific metrics for ActiveMQ, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, HBase, Kafka, Tomcat, and Zookeeper. The agent can also be easily configured to extract custom JMX metrics coming from your own Java processes. Metrics extracted are shown in the pre-defined Application views or under the Metrics > JVM and JMX menus. The default JMX metrics configuration is found in the \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.default.yaml file. When customizing existing entries, copy the complete application's bean listing from that defaults yaml file into the user settings file \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml . The Sysdig agent will merge configurations of both files. Here is what your dragent.yaml file might look like for a customized entry for the Spark application: customerid: 07c948-your-key-here-006f3b\ntags: local:nyc,service:db3\njmx:\n per_process_beans:\n spark: \n pattern: \"spark\"\n beans:\n - query: \"metrics:name=Spark shell.BlockManager.disk.diskSpaceUsed_MB\"\n attributes:\n - name: VALUE \n alias: spark.metric Include the jmx: and per_process_beans: section headers at the beginning of your application\/bean list. For more information on adding parameters to a container agent's configuration file, see Understanding the Agent Config Files . Contents Bean Configuration Limits Aliases Troubleshooting: Why Can't I See Java (JMX) Metrics? JMX Remote Java Versions Java-Based Applications and JMX Authentication Disabling JMX Polling Bean Configuration Basic JVM metrics are pre-defined inside the default_beans: section. This section is defined in the agent's default settings file and contains beans and attributes that are going to be polled for every Java process, like memory and garbage collector usage: jmx:\n default_beans:\n - query: \"java.lang:type=Memory\"\n attributes:\n - HeapMemoryUsage\n - NonHeapMemoryUsage\n - query: \"java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,*\"\n attributes:\n - name: \"CollectionCount\"\n type: \"counter\"\n - name: \"CollectionTime\"\n type: \"counter\" Metrics specific for each application are specified in sections named after the applications. For example, this is the Tomcat section: per_process_beans:\n tomcat:\n pattern: \"catalina\"\n beans:\n - query: \"Catalina:type=Cache,*\"\n attributes:\n - accessCount\n - cacheSize\n - hitsCount\n - . . . The key name, tomcat in this case, will be displayed as a process name in the Sysdig Monitor user interface instead of just java . The pattern: parameter specifies a string that is used to match a java process name and arguments with this set of JMX metrics. If the process main class full name contains the given text, the process is tagged and the metrics specified in the section will be fetched. The class names are matched against the process argument list. If you implement JMX metrics in a custom manner that does not expose the class names on the command line, you will need to find a pattern which conveniently matches your java invocation command line. The beans: section contains the list of beans to be queried, based on JMX patterns. JMX patterns are explained in details in the Oracle documentation , but in practice, the format of the query line is pretty simple: you can specify the full name of the bean like java.lang:type=Memory , or you can fetch multiple beans in a single line using the wildcard * as in: java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,* To get the list of all the beans that your application exports, you can use JVisualVM , Jmxterm , JConsole or other similar tools. Here is a screenshot from JConsole showing where to find the namespace, bean and attribute (metric) information (JConsole is available when you install the Java Development Kit): For each query, you can specify the attributes that you want to retrieve. We support the following JMX attributes (For these attributes, all the subattributes will be retrieved): Numeric CompositeDataSupport Attributes may be absolute values or rates. For values, we need to calculate a per second rate before sending them. In this case, you can specify type: counter , the default is rate which can be omitted, so usually you can simply write the attribute name. Limits The total number of JMX metrics polled per host is limited to 500. The maximum number of beans queried per process is limited to 300. If more metrics are needed please contact your sales representative with your use case. In agents 0.46 and earlier, the limit was 100 beans for each process. Aliases JMX beans and attributes can have very long names. To avoid interface cluttering we added support for aliasing, you can specify an alias in the attribute configuration. For example: cassandra:\n pattern: \"cassandra\"\n beans:\n - query: \"org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageProxy\n attributes:\n - name: RecentWriteLatencyMicros\n alias: cassandra.write.latency\n - name: RecentReadLatencyMicros\n alias: cassandra.read.latency In this way the alias will be used in Sysdig Monitor instead of the raw bean name. Aliases can be dynamic as well, getting data from the bean name - useful where you use pattern bean queries. For example: - query: \"java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,*\"\n attributes:\n - name: CollectionCount\n type: counter\n alias: jvm.gc.NAME.count\n - name: CollectionTime\n type: counter\n alias: jvm.gc.NAME.time This query will match multiple beans (All Garbage collectors) and the metric name will reflect the name of the Garbage Collector. For example: jvm.gc.ConcurrentMarkSweep.count . General syntax is: {<bean_property_key>} , to get all beans properties you can use a JMX explorer like JVisualVM or Jmxterm. Troubleshooting: Why Can't I See Java (JMX) Metrics? The Sysdig agent normally auto-discovers Java processes running on your host and enables the JMX extensions for polling them. JMX Remote If your Java application is not discovered automatically by the agent, try adding the following parameter on your application's command line: -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote For more information, see Oracle's web page on monitoring using JMX technology . Java Versions Only Java versions 7 and 8 are currently supported by the Sysdig agent. If you do not see JMX metrics reporting, your Java version may be older or newer. Java-Based Applications and JMX Authentication For Java-based applications (Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Tomcat, Zookeeper and etc.), the Sysdig agent requires the Java runtime environment (JRE) to be installed to poll for metrics (beans). The Sysdig agent does not support JMX authentication. If the Docker-container-based Sysdig agent is installed, the JRE is installed alongside the agent binaries and no further dependencies exist. However, if you are installing the service-based agent (non-container) and you do not see the JVM\/JMX metrics reporting, your host may not have the JRE installed or it may not be installed in the expected location: usr\/bin\/java To confirm if the Sysdig agent is able to find the JRE, restart the agent with service dragent restart and check the agent's \/opt\/draios\/logs\/draios.log file for the two Java detection and location log entries recorded during agent startup. Example if Java is missing or not found: \n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java detected: false\n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java_binary: Example if Java is found: \n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java detected: true\n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java_binary: \/usr\/bin\/java If Java is not installed, the resolution is to install the Java Runtime Environment . If your host has Java installed but not in the expected location ( \/usr\/bin\/java ) you can install a symlink from \/usr\/bin\/java to the actual binary OR set the java_home: variable in the Sysdig agent's configuration file: \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml java_home: \/usr\/my_java_location\/ Disabling JMX Polling If you do not need it or otherwise want to disable JMX metrics reporting, you can add the following two lines to the agent's user settings configuration file \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml : jmx:\n enabled: false After editing the file, restart the native Linux agent via service dragent restart or restart the container agent to make the change take effect. If using our containerized agent, instead of editing the dragent.yaml file, you can add this extra parameter in the docker run command when starting the agent: \n-e ADDITIONAL_CONF=\"jmx:\\n enabled: false\\n\" " },

"body" : " StatsD is an open source project built by Etsy. Using a StatsD library specific to your application's language, it allows for the easy generation and transmission of custom application metrics to a collection server. The Sysdig agent contains an embedded StatsD server, so your custom metrics can now be sent to our collector and be relayed to the Sysdig Monitor backend for aggregation. Your application metrics and the rich set of metrics collected by our agent already can all be visualized in the same simple and intuitive graphical interface. Configuring alert notifications is also exactly the same. Contents Installation and Configuration Sending StatsD Metrics Active Collection Passive Collection Supported Metric Types Counter Gauge Set Metric Labels Limits Compatible Clients Turning Off StatsD Reporting Changing the StatsD Listener Port and Transport Protocol Characters Allowed For StatsD Metric Names Installation and Configuration The Statsd server, embedded in Sysdig agent beginning with version 0.1.136, is pre-configured and starts by default so no additional user configuration is necessary. Install the agent in a supported distribution directly or install the Docker containerized version in your container server and you're done. Sending StatsD Metrics Active Collection By default, the Sysdig agent's embedded StatsD collector listens on the standard StatsD port, 8125 , both on TCP and UDP. StatsD is a text based protocol , where samples are separated by a \\n . Sending metrics from your application to the collector is as simple as: \necho \"hello_statsd:1|c\" > \/dev\/udp\/127.0.0.1\/8125 The example transmits the counter metric \"hello_statsd\" with a value of '1' to the Statsd collector listening on UDP port 8125. Here is a second example sending the output of a more complex shell command giving the number of established network connections: \necho \"EstablishedConnections:`netstat -a | grep ESTAB | wc -l`|c\" > \/dev\/udp\/127.0.0.1\/8125 The protocol format is as follows: \nMETRIC_NAME:METRIC_VALUE|TYPE[|@SAMPLING_RATIO] Metric names can be any string except reserved characters: |#:@ . Value is a number and depends on the metric type. Type can be any of: c , ms , g , s . Sampling ratio is a value between 0 (exclusive) and 1 and it's used to handle subsampling. When sent, metrics will be available in the same display menu for the subviews as the built in metrics. Passive Collection In infrastructures already containing a third party StatsD collection server, StatsD metrics can be collected \"out of band\". A passive collection technique is automatically performed by our agent by intercepting system calls - as is done for all the Sysdig Monitor metrics normally collected. This method does not require changing your current StatsD configuration and is an excellent way to 'test drive' the Sysdig Monitor application without having to perform any modifications other than agent installation. The passive mode of collection is especially suitable for containerized environments where simplicity and efficiency are essential. With the containerized version of the Sysdig Monitor agent running on the host, all other container applications can continue to transmit to any currently implemented collector. In the case where no collector exists, container applications can simply be configured to send StatsD metrics to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1) as demonstrated above - no actual StatsD server needs to be listening at that address. Effectively, each network transmission made from inside the application container, including statsd messages sent to a non existent destination, generates a system call. The Sysdig agent captures these system calls from its own container, where the statsd collector is listening. In practice, the Sysdig agent acts as a transparent proxy between the application and the StatsD collector, even if they are in different containers. The agent correlates which container a system call is coming from, and uses that information to transparently label the StatsD messages. The above graphic demonstrates the components of the Sysdig agent and where metrics are actively or passively collected. Regardless of the method of collection, the number of StatsD metrics the agent can transmit is limited by your payment plan. Note 1 : When using the passive technique, ICMP port unreachable events may be generated on the host network. Note 2: Some clients may use IPv6 addressing (::1) for the \"localhost\" address string. Metrics collection over IPv6 is not supported at this time. If your StatsD metrics are not visible in the Sysdig Monitor interface, please use \"127.0.0.1\" instead of \"localhost\" string to force IPv4. Another solution that may be required is adding the JVM option: java.net .preferIPv4Stack=true. Note 3 : When StatsD metrics are not continuously transmitted by your application (once per second as in the case of all agent created metrics), the charts will render a 'zero' or null value. Any alert conditions will only look at those Statsd values actually transmitted and ignore the nulls. For more detail on the benefits of Sysdig Monitor's implementation of StatsD, please see the article State of the Art: StatsD Deployment Strategies in Containerized Environments . Supported Metric Types Counter A counter metric is updated with the value sent by the application, sent to the Sysdig Monitor backend, and then reset to zero. You can use it to count, for example, how many calls have been made to an API: api.login:1|c You can specify negative values to decrement a counter. Gauge A gauge is a single value that will be sent as is: table_size:10000|g These are plotted as received, in the sense, they are at a point in time metrics. You can achieve relative increments or decrements on a counter by prepending the value with a + or a - respectively. As an example, these three samples will cause table_size to be 950: table_size:1000|g\ntable_size:-100|g\ntable_size:+50|g In Sysdig Monitor, the gauge value is only rendered on the various charts when it is actually transmitted by your application. When not transmitted, a null is plotted on the charts which is not used in any calculations or alerts. Set A set is like a counter, but it counts unique elements. For example: \nactive_users:user1|s active_users:user2|sactive_users:user1|s Will cause the value of active_users to be 2. Metric Labels Labels are an extension of the StatsD specification offered by Sysdig Monitor to offer better flexibility in the way metrics are grouped, filtered and visualized. Labeling can be achieved by using the following syntax: enqueued_messages#users,country=italy:10|c In general, this is the syntax you can use for labeling: \nMETRIC_NAME#LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE,LABEL_NAME ... Labels can be simple strings or key\/value pairs, separated by an = sign. Simple labels can be used for filtering in the Sysdig Monitor web interface. Key\/value labels can be used for both filtering and segmentation. Label names prefixed with 'agent.label' are reserved for Sysdig agent use only and any custom labels starting with that prefix will be ignored. Limits The number of StatsD metrics the agent can transmit is limited to 100 for the host and 100 for all running containers combined. If more metrics are needed please contact your sales representative with your use case. Compatible Clients Every StatsD compliant client works with our implementation. Here is a quick list, it's provided just as reference. We don't support them, we support only the protocol specification compliance.

"body" : " Introduction Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments Summary of Functionality Configuration Main Config Parameters Process Filter conf Authentication Integration conf Authentication Example Kubernetes Objects Examples Histograms Logging Troubleshooting Legacy Prometheus Application Check Introduction Starting with version 0.70.0, the Sysdig Monitor Agent provides rich support for automatically scraping metrics from Prometheus exporters . This article describes default behaviors and how to further configure the feature to specify which processes and ports should be targeted for scraping. See our blog post for additional context on the Prometheus metric format and how such metrics are typically used. The Sysdig Monitor Agent also had rudimentary Prometheus support in versions older than 0.70.0. If you were using this functionality, see the section below on the Legacy Prometheus Application Check for important upgrade information. Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments Prometheus users who are already leveraging Kubernetes Service Discovery (specifically the approach in this sample prometheus-kubernetes.yml ) may already have Annotations attached to their Pods that mark them as eligible for scraping. Such environments can quickly begin scraping the same metrics using the Sysdig Agent in a couple easy steps. Enable the Prometheus metrics feature in the Sysdig Agent. Assuming you are deploying using DaemonSets , the needed config can be added to the Agent's dragent.yaml by including the following in your DaemonSet YAML (placing it in the env section for the sysdig-agent container): - name: ADDITIONAL_CONF\n value: \"prometheus:\\n enabled: true\"\n\n Ensure the Kubernetes Pods that contain your Prometheus exporters have been deployed with the following Annotations to enable scraping (substituting the listening exporter-TCP-port) : spec:\n template:\n metadata:\n annotations:\n prometheus.io\/scrape: \"true\"\n prometheus.io\/port: \"exporter-TCP-port\" The configuration above assumes your exporters use the typical endpoint called \/metrics . If an exporter is using a different endpoint, this can also be specified by adding the following additional optional Annotation, substituting the exporter-endpoint-name : \nprometheus.io\/path: \"\/exporter-endpoint-name\" If you try this Kubernetes Deployment of a simple exporter , you will quickly see auto-discovered Prometheus metrics being displayed in Sysdig Monitor. You can use this working example as a basis to similarly Annotate your own exporters. If you have Prometheus exporters not deployed in annotated Kubernetes Pods that you would like to scrape, the following sections describe the full set of options to configure the Agent to find and scrape your metrics. Summary of Functionality The Sysdig Monitor Agent uses its visibility to all running processes (at both the host and container levels) to find eligible targets for scraping Prometheus metrics. By default, no scraping is attempted. Once the feature is enabled, the Agent assembles a list of eligible targets in two steps: A process is determined to be eligible for possible scraping if it positively matches against a series of Process Filter include\/exclude rules. The Agent will then attempt to scrape an eligible process at a \/metrics endpoint on all of its listening TCP ports, unless additional configuration is present to restrict scraping to a subset of ports and\/or another endpoint name. The metrics ultimately appear in the Sysdig Monitor Explore interface in the Prometheus section. Within the set of eligible processes\/ports\/endpoints, the Agent uses an auto-discover approach to scrape only ports that are exporting Prometheus metrics, and will stop attempting to scrape or retry on ports based on how they respond to attempts to connect and scrape them. It is therefore strongly recommended that you create a configuration that restricts the process and ports for attempted scraping to the minimum expected range for your exporters. This minimizes the potential for unintended side-effects in both the Agent and your applications due to repeated failed connection attempts. Configuration As is typical for the Agent, the default configuration for the feature is specified in dragent.default.yaml , and you can override the defaults by configuring parameters in the dragent.yaml . For each parameter you do not set in dragent.yaml , the defaults in dragent.default.yaml will remain in effect. Main Config Parameters Parameter Default Description enabled false Turns Prometheus scraping on\/off. interval 10 How often (in seconds) the Agent will scrape a port for Prometheus metrics log_errors true Whether the Agent should log details on failed attempts to scrape eligible targets max_metrics 1000 The maximum number of total Prometheus metrics that will be scraped across all targets. This value of 1000 is the maximum per-Agent, and is a separate limit from other Custom Metrics (e.g. statsd , JMX , and other Application Checks ). max_metrics_per_process 100 The maximum number of Prometheus metrics that the Agent will save from a single scraped target max_tags_per_metric 20 The maximum number of tags per Prometheus metric that the Agent will save from a scraped target histograms false Whether the Agent should scrape and report histogram metrics. See the section below on histograms for details. process_filter See below Specifies which processes may be eligible for scraping. See the Process Filter section below. Process Filter The process_filter section specifies which of the processes known by an Agent may be eligible for scraping. Note that once you specify a process_filter in your dragent.yaml , this replaces the entire Prometheus process_filter section (i.e. all rules) shown in the dragent.default.yaml . The Process Filter is specified in a series of include and exclude rules that are evaluated top-to-bottom for each process known by an Agent. If a process matches an include rule, scraping will be attempted via a \/metrics endpoint on each listening TCP port for the process, unless a conf section also appears within the rule to further restrict how the process will be scraped (see the \"conf\" section below). Multiple patterns can be specified in a single rule, in which case all patterns must match for the rule to be a match (AND logic). Within a pattern value, simple \"glob\" wildcarding may be used, where * matches any number of characters (including none) and ? matches any single character. Note that due to YAML syntax, when using wildcards, be sure to enclose the value in quotes ( \"*\" ). The table below describes the supported patterns in Process Filter rules. To provide realistic examples, we'll use a simple sample Prometheus exporter (source code here ) which can be deployed as a container using the Docker command line below. To help illustrate some of the configuration options, this sample exporter presents Prometheus metrics on \/promtheus instead of the more common \/metrics endpoint, which will be shown in the example configurations further below. # docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \\\n --label class=\"exporter\" \\\n --name my-java-app \\\n luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n \n# ps auxww | grep app.jar\nroot 11502 95.9 9.2 3745724 753632 ? Ssl 15:52 1:42 java -jar \/app.jar --management.security.enabled=false\n \n# curl http:\/\/localhost:8080\/prometheus\n...\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.005\",} 6.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.01\",} 17.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.025\",} 51.0\n... Pattern name Description Example container.image Matches if the process is running inside a container running the specified image - include: container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app container.name Matches if the process is running inside a container with the specified name - include: container.name: my-java-app container.label.* Matches if the process is running in a container that has a Label matching the given value - include: container.label.class: exporter kubernetes.<object>.annotation.* kubernetes.<object>.label.* Matches if the process is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with the Annotation\/Label matching the given value. Note: This pattern does not apply to the Docker-only command-line shown above, but would instead apply if the exporter were installed as a Kubernetes Deployment using this example YAML . Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. - include: kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: true process.name Matches the name of the running process - include: process.name: java process.cmdline Matches a command line argument - include: process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\" port Matches if the process is listening on one or more TCP ports. The pattern for a single rule can specify a single port as shown in this example, or a single range (e.g. 8079-8081 ), but does not support comma-separated lists of ports\/ranges. Note: This parameter is only used to confirm if a process is eligible for scraping based on the ports on which it is listening. For example, if a process is listening on one port for application traffic and has a second port open for exporting Prometheus metrics, it would be possible to specify the application port here (but not the exporting port), and the exporting port in the conf section (but not the application port), and the process would be matched as eligible and the exporting port would be scraped. - include: port: 8080 appcheck.match Matches if an Application Check with the specific name or pattern is scheduled to run for the process. - exclude: appcheck.match: \"*\" Instead of the include examples shown above that would have each matched our process, due to the previously-described ability to combine multiple patterns in a single rule, the following very strict configuration would also have matched: - include:\n container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n container.name: my-java-app\n container.label.class: exporter\n process.name: java\n process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\"\n port: 8080 conf Each include rule in the port_filter may include a conf portion that further describes how scraping will be attempted on the eligible process. If a conf portion is not included, scraping will be attempted at a \/metrics endpoint on all listening ports of the matching process. The possible settings: Parameter name Description Example port Either a static number for a single TCP port to be scraped, or a container\/Kubernetes Label name or Kubernetes Annotation specified in curly braces. If the process is running in a container that is marked with this Label or is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with this Annotation\/Label, scraping will be attempted only on the port specified as the value of the Label\/Annotation. Note: The Label\/Annotation to match against will not include the text shown in red . Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. Note: If running the exporter inside a container, this should specify the port number that the exporter process in the container is listening on, not the port that the container exposes to the host. port: 8080 - or - port: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.port}\" - or - port: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/port}\" port_filter A set of include and exclude rules that define the ultimate set of listening TCP ports for an eligible process on which scraping may be attempted. Note that the syntax is different from the port pattern option from within the higher-level include rule in the process_filter . Here a given rule can include single ports, comma-separated lists of ports (enclosed in square brackets), or contiguous port ranges (without brackets). port_filter: - include: 8080 - exclude: [9092,9200,9300] - include: 9090-9100 path Either the static specification of an endpoint to be scraped, or a container\/Kubernetes Label name or Kubernetes Annotation specified in curly braces. If the process is running in a container that is marked with this Label or is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with this Annotation\/Label, scraping will be attempted via the endpoint specified as the value of the Label\/Annotation. If path is not specified, or specified but the Agent does not find the Label\/Annotation attached to the process, the common Prometheus exporter default of \/metrics will be used. Note: A Label\/Annotation to match against will not include the text shown in red . Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. path: \"\/prometheus\" - or - path: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.path}\" - or - path: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/path}\" host A hostname or IP address. The default is localhost. host: 192.168.1.101\n- or -\nhost: subdomain.example.com\n- or -\nhost: localhost use_https When set to true , connectivity to the exporter will only be attempted through HTTPS instead of HTTP. It is false by default. (Available in Agent version 0.79.0 and newer) use_https: true ssl_verify When set to true , verification will be performed for the server certificates for an HTTPS connection. It is false by default. Verification was enabled by default before 0.79.0. (Available in Agent version 0.79.0 and newer) ssl_verify: true Authentication Integration As of agent version 0.89, Sysdig can collect Prometheus metrics from endpoints requiring authentication. Use the parameters below to enable this function. For username\/password authentication: username password For authentication using a token: auth_token_path For certificate authentication with a certificate key: auth_cert_path auth_key_path Token substitution is also supported for all the authorization parameters. For instance a username can be taken from a Kubernetes annotation by specifying username: \"{ kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/username }\" conf Authentication Example Below is an example of the dragent.yaml section showing all the Prometheus authentication configuration options, on OpenShift, Kubernetes, and etcd. In this example: The username\/password are taken from a default annotation used by OpenShift. The auth token path is commonly available in Kubernetes deployments. The certificate and key used here for etcd may normally not be as easily accessible to the agent. In this case they were extracted from the host namespace, constructed into Kubernetes secrets, and then mounted into the agent container. prometheus: \n enabled: true\n process_filter: \n - include: \n port: 1936\n conf: \n username: \"{kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/username}\"\n password: \"{kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/password}\"\n - include: \n process.name: kubelet\n conf: \n port: 10250\n use_https: true\n auth_token_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/kubernetes.io\/serviceaccount\/token\"\n - include: \n process.name: etcd\n conf: \n port: 2379\n use_https: true\n auth_cert_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/etcd\/client-cert\"\n auth_key_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/etcd\/client-key\" Kubernetes Objects As described above, there are multiple configuration options that can be set based on auto-discovered values for Kubernetes Labels and\/or Annotations. The format in each case begins with \"kubernetes.OBJECT.annotation.\" or \"kubernetes.OBJECT.label.\" where OBJECT can be any of the following supported Kubernetes object types: daemonSet deployment namespace node pod replicaSet replicationController service statefulset The configuration text you add after the final dot becomes the name of the Kubernetes Label\/Annotation that the Agent will look for. If the Label\/Annotation is discovered attached to the process, the value of that Label\/Annotation will be used for the configuration option. Note that there are multiple ways for a Kubernetes Label\/Annotation to be attached to a particular process. One of the simplest examples of this is the Pod-based approach shown above in the Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments . However, as an example alternative to marking at the Pod level, you could attach Labels\/Annotations at the Namespace level, in which case auto-discovered configuration options would apply to all processes running in that Namespace regardless of whether they're in a Deployment, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, etc. Examples As an example that pulls together many of the configuration elements shown above, consider the default Agent configuration that's inherited from the dragent.default.yaml . prometheus:\n enabled: false\n interval: 10\n log_errors: true\n max_metrics: 1000\n max_metrics_per_process: 100\n max_tags_per_metric: 20\n \n # Filtering processes to scan. Processes not matching a rule will not\n # be scanned\n # If an include rule doesn't contain a port or port_filter in the conf\n # section, we will scan all the ports that a matching process is listening to.\n process_filter:\n - exclude:\n process.name: docker-proxy\n - exclude:\n container.image: sysdig\/agent\n # special rule to exclude processes matching configured prometheus appcheck\n - exclude:\n appcheck.match: prometheus\n - include:\n container.label.io.prometheus.scrape: \"true\"\n conf:\n # Custom path definition\n # If the Label doesn't exist we'll still use \"\/metrics\"\n path: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.path}\"\n \n # Port definition\n # - If the Label exists, only scan the given port.\n # - If it doesn't, use port_filter instead.\n # - If there is no port_filter defined, skip this process\n port: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.port}\"\n port_filter:\n - exclude: [9092,9200,9300]\n - include: 9090-9500\n - include: [9913,9984,24231,42004]\n - exclude:\n container.label.io.prometheus.scrape: \"false\"\n - include:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: true\n conf:\n path: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/path}\"\n port: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/port}\"\n - exclude:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: false Things to note about this default configuration: Once enabled, this default configuration is ideal for the use case described above in the Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments . All Prometheus scraping is disabled by default to allow for a smooth transition for users of the legacy Prometheus Application Check (see the note below ). To enable the entire config shown here, you would only need to add the following to your dragent.yaml : prometheus:\n enabled: true A Process Filter rule excludes processes that are likely to exist in most environments but are known to never export Prometheus metrics, such as the Docker Proxy and the Agent itself. Another Process Filter rule ensures that any processes configured to be scraped by the legacy Prometheus Application Check will not be scraped. See the section below on the Legacy Prometheus Application Check for details. Another Process Filter rule is tailored to use of container Labels. Processes marked with the container Label io.prometheus.scrape will become eligible for scraping, and if further marked with container Labels io.prometheus.port and\/or io.prometheus.path , scraping will be attempted only on this port and\/or endpoint. If the container is not marked with the specified path Label, scraping the \/metrics endpoint will be attempted. If the container is not marked with the specified port Label, any listening ports in the port_filter will be attempted for scraping (this port_filter in the default is set for the range of ports for common Prometheus exporters , with exclusions for ports in the range that are known to be used by other applications that are not exporters). The final Process Filter include rule is tailored to the use case described above in Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments . With this default configuration enabled, a containerized install of our example exporter shown below would be automatically scraped via the Agent. # docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \\\n --label io.prometheus.scrape=\"true\" \\\n --label io.prometheus.port=\"8080\" \\\n --label io.prometheus.path=\"\/prometheus\" \\\n luca3m\/prometheus-java-app Similarly, in a Kubernetes-based environment, a Deployment with the Annotations as shown in using this example YAML would also be scraped by enabling the default configuration. apiVersion: extensions\/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n name: prometheus-java-app\nspec:\n replicas: 1\n template:\n metadata:\n labels:\n app: prometheus-java-app\n annotations:\n prometheus.io\/scrape: \"true\"\n prometheus.io\/path: \"\/prometheus\"\n prometheus.io\/port: \"8080\"\n spec:\n containers:\n - name: prometheus-java-app\n image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n imagePullPolicy: Always\n\n Finally, we'll consider an example for a non-containerized environment or a containerized environment that doesn't use Labels or Annotations. The following dragent.yaml would override the default and do per-second scrapes of our sample exporter and also a second exporter on port 5005, each at their respective non-standard endpoints. This can be thought of as a conservative \"whitelist\" type of configuration since it restricts scraping to only exporters that are known to exist in the environment and the ports on which they're known to export Prometheus metrics. prometheus:\n enabled: true\n interval: 1\n process_filter:\n - include:\n process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\"\n conf:\n port: 8080\n path: \"\/prometheus\"\n - include:\n port: 5005\n conf:\n port: 5005\n path: \"\/wacko\" Histograms By default, the Agent does not scrape details for the histogram metrics reported by exporters. To enable this, include the additional histograms option: prometheus:\n enabled: true\n histograms: true Note that the way Prometheus histograms are typically reported by exporters, they are cumulative across buckets and also report accumulations within each bucket range since the exporter started. To make this data easier to visualize, the Sysdig Monitor application presents histogram data as a delta over the selected time range. For instance, below we've had our sample Prometheus exporter running for over an hour, accumulating data in a histogram metric called random: # curl http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8080\/prometheus\n...\n# HELP random Random sleep\n# TYPE random histogram\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.005\",} 33.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.01\",} 74.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.025\",} 180.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.05\",} 404.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.075\",} 639.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.1\",} 848.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.25\",} 2145.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.5\",} 4307.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.75\",} 6371.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"1.0\",} 8592.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"2.5\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"5.0\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"7.5\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"10.0\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"+Inf\",} 8619.0\n... However in the Sysdig Monitor interface, if we select the metric and a time range such as 10 minutes, we'll see the per-bucket distribution for only that time range. Hover your mouse over a particular bar to see the bucket range. If this histogram metric is being reported from multiple sources, you will see the contribution to the total from each source based on your choice of Segment by . In this case we are segmenting by hostname and only have one contributing source, called \"ubuntu16\". Logging After the Agent begins scraping Prometheus metrics, there may be a delay of up to a few minutes before the metrics become visible in Sysdig Monitor. To help quickly confirm your configuration is correct, starting with Agent version 0.80.0, the following log line will appear in the Agent log the first time since since starting that it has found and is successfully scraping at least one Prometheus exporter: \n2018-05-04 21:42:10.048, 8820, Information, 05-04 21:42:10.048324 Starting export of Prometheus metrics As this is an INFO level log message, it will appear in Agents using the default logging settings. To reveal even more detail, increase the Agent log level to DEBUG , which produces a message like the following that reveals the name of a specific metric first detected. You can then look for this metric to be visible in Sysdig Monitor shortly after. \n2018-05-04 21:50:46.068, 11212, Debug, 05-04 21:50:46.068141 First prometheus metrics since agent start: pid 9583: 5 metrics including: randomSummary.95percentile Troubleshooting See the previous section for information on expected log messages during successful scraping. If you have enabled Prometheus and are not seeing the Starting export message shown there, revisit your configuration. It is also suggested to leave the configuration option in its default setting of log_errors: true , which will reveal any issues scraping eligible processes in the Agent log. For example, here is an error message for a failed scrape of a TCP port that was listening but not accepting HTTP requests: \n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks[4987] Exception on running check prometheus.5000: Exception('Timeout when hitting http:\/\/localhost:5000\/metrics',)\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, Traceback (most recent call last):\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, File \"\/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/sdchecks.py\", line 246, in run\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, self.check_instance.check(self.instance_conf)\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, File \"\/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/checks.d\/prometheus.py\", line 44, in check\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, metrics = self.get_prometheus_metrics(query_url, timeout, \"prometheus\")\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, File \"\/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/checks.d\/prometheus.py\", line 105, in get_prometheus_metrics\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.077, 4984, Error, sdchecks, raise Exception(\"Timeout when hitting %s\" % url)\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.077, 4984, Error, sdchecks, Exception: Timeout when hitting http:\/\/localhost:5000\/metrics Here is an example error message for a failed scrape of a port that was responding to HTTP requests on the \/metrics endpoint but not responding with valid Prometheus-format data.

And the corresponding error message in the Agent log, indicating no further scraping will be attempted after the initial failure: \n2017-10-13 22:03:05.081, 5216, Information, sdchecks[5219] Skip retries for Prometheus error: could not convert string to float: ain't\n2017-10-13 22:03:05.082, 5216, Error, sdchecks[5219] Exception on running check prometheus.5002: could not convert string to float: ain't Legacy Prometheus Application Check Special care should be taken if you're already using the legacy Prometheus Application Check (explained below) to scrape any Prometheus metrics. You will be able to scrape for the same metrics using the new approach and they will appear in Sysdig Monitor under the same metric name. However, any historical data from when it was collected via the legacy Prometheus App Check will no longer be visible. As a result, the new approach is disabled by default, and you should carefully plan your transition to using the new approach for each set of metrics when you feel you can endure the break with historical data. The legacy Prometheus application check is able to collect metrics from a static external HTTP endpoint exposing metrics in Prometheus format and import them as StatsD metrics in Sysdig. To configure the legacy Prometheus application check, Add these lines to the agent's configuration file: app_checks:\n - name: prometheus\n pattern:\n comm: python\n arg: \/opt\/draios\/bin\/sdchecks\n conf:\n url: http:\/\/{YOUR_PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_IP}:8080\/metrics " },

"body" : "The Sysdig agent supports additional application monitoring capabilities with application check scripts or 'app checks'. These are a set of plugins that poll for custom metrics from the specific applications which export them via status or management pages: e.g. NGINX, Redis, MongoDB, Memcached and more. Many app checks are enabled by default in the agent and when a supported application is found, the correct app check script will be called and metrics polled automatically. However if default connection parameters are changed in your application, you will need to modify the app check connection parameters in the Sysdig Agent configuration file ( dragent.yaml) to match your application. In some cases you may also need to enable the metrics reporting functionality in the application before the agent can poll them. This page details how to make configuration changes in the agent's configuration file, and provides an application integration example. Click the Supported Applications links for application-specific details. Contents Edit dragent.yaml to Integrate or Modify Application Checks Find the default settings Sample format Change the default settings Example 1: Change Name and Add Password Example 2: Increase Polling Interval Disabling Disable a Single Application Check Disable ALL Application Checks Optional: Configure a Custom App-Check Metrics Limit Supported Applications Edit dragent.yaml to Integrate or Modify Application Checks Out of the box, the Sysdig agent will gather and report on a wide variety of pre-defined metrics. It can also accommodate any number of custom parameters for additional metrics collection. The agent relies on a pair of configuration files to define metrics collection parameters: dragent.default.yaml The core configuration file. You can look at it to understand more about the default configurations provided. Location: \" \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.default.yaml .\" CAUTION. This file should never be edited. dragent.yaml The configuration file where parameters can be added, either directly in YAML as name\/value pairs, or using environment variables such as ' ADDITIONAL_CONF.\" Location: \" \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml .\" The \" dragent.yaml \" file can be accessed and edited in several ways, depending on how the agent was installed. Review Understanding the Agent Config Files for details. The examples in this section presume you are entering YAML code directly into dragent.yaml, under the app_checks section. Find the default settings To find the default app-checks for already supported applications, check the dragent.default.yaml file. (Location: \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.default.yaml .) Sample format app_checks: \n - name: APP_NAME\n check_module: APP_CHECK_SCRIPT\n pattern: \n comm: PROCESS_NAME \n conf: \n host: IP_ADDR\n port: PORT Parameter Parameter 2 Description Sample Value app_checks The main section of dragent.default.yaml that contains a list of pre-configured checks. n\/a name Every check should have a unique name: which will be displayed on Sysdig Monitor as the process name of the integrated application. e.g. MongoDB check_module The name of the Python plugin that polls the data from the designated application. All the app check scripts can be found inside the \/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/checks.d directory. e.g. elastic pattern This section is used by the Sysdig agent to match a process with a check. Four kinds of keys can be specified along with any arguments to help distinguish them. n\/a comm Matches process name as seen in \/proc\/ PID \/status port Matches process name as seen in \/proc\/ PID \/status arg Matches any process arguments exe Matches the process exe as seen in \/proc\/ PID \/exe link conf This section is specific for each plugin. You can specify any key\/values that the plugins support. host Application-specific. A URL or IP address port {...} tokens can be used as values, which will be substituted with values from process info. Change the default settings To override the defaults: Copy relevant code blocks from dragent.default.yaml into dragent.yaml . (Or copy the code from the appropriate app check integration page in this documentation section.) Any entries copied into dragent.yaml file will override similar entries in dragent.default.yaml . Never modify dragent.default.yaml , as it will be overwritten whenever the agent is updated. Modify the parameters as needed. Be sure to use proper YAML. Pay attention to consistent spacing for indents (as shown) and list all check entries under an app_checks: section title. Save the changes and restart the agent. Use service restart agent or docker restart sysdig-agent . Metrics for the relevant application should appear in the Sysdig Monitor interface under the appropriate name. Example 1: Change Name and Add Password Here is a sample app-check entry for Redis. The app_checks section was copied from the dragent.default.yaml file and modified for a specific instance. customerid: 831f3-Your-Access-Key-9401\ntags: local:sf,acct:dev,svc:db\napp_checks: \n - name: redis-6380\n check_module: redisdb\n pattern: \n comm: redis-server \n conf: \n host: 127.0.0.1\n port: PORT\n password: PASSWORD Edits made: The name to be displayed in the interface A required password. As the token PORT is used, it will be translated to the actual port where Redis is listening. Example 2: Increase Polling Interval The default interval for an application check to be run by the agent is set to every second. You can increase the interval per application check by adding the interval: parameter (under the -name section) and the number of seconds to wait before each run of the script. interval: must be put into each app check entry that should run less often; there is no global setting. Example: Run the NTP check once per minute: app_checks:\n - name: ntp\n interval: 60\n pattern:\n comm: systemd\n conf:\n host: us.pool.ntp.org Disabling Disable a Single Application Check Sometimes the default configuration shipped with the Sysdig agent does not work for you or you may not be interested in checks for a single application. To turn a single check off, add an entry like this to disable it: app_checks: \n - name: nginx\n enabled: false This entry overrides the default configuration of the nginx check, disabling it. If you are using the ADDITIONAL_CONF parameter to modify your container agent's configuration, you would add an entry like this to your Docker run command (or Kubernetes manifest): \n-e ADDITIONAL_CONF=\"app_checks:\\n - name: nginx\\n enabled: false\\n\" Disable ALL Application Checks If you do not need it or otherwise want to disable the application check functionality, you can add the following entry to the agent's user settings configuration file \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml : app_checks_enabled: false Restart the agent as shown immediately above for either the native Linux agent installation or the container agent installation. Optional: Configure a Custom App-Check Sysdig allows custom application check-script configurations to be created for each individual container in the infrastructure, via the environment variable SYSDIG_AGENT_CONF . This avoids the need for multiple edits and entries to achieve the container-specific customization, by enabling application teams to configure their own checks. The SYSDIG_AGENT_CONF variable stores a YAML-formatted configuration for the app check, and is used to match app-check configurations. It can be stored directly within the Docker file. The syntax is the same as dragent.yaml syntax. The example below defines a per container app-check for Redis in the Dockerfile, using the SYSDIG_AGENT_CONF environment variable: FROM redis\n# This config file adds a password for accessing redis instance\nADD redis.conf \/\n\nENV SYSDIG_AGENT_CONF { \"app_checks\": [{ \"name\": \"redis\", \"check_module\": \"redisdb\", \"pattern\": {\"comm\": \"redis-server\"}, \"conf\": { \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": \"6379\", \"password\": \"protected\"} }] }\nENTRYPOINT [\"redis-server\"]\nCMD [ \"\/redis.conf\" ] The example below shows how parameters can be added to a container started with docker run , by either using the -e\/–envflag variable, or injecting the parameters using an orchestration system (for example, Kubernetes): \nPER_CONTAINER_CONF='{ \"app_checks\": [{ \"name\": \"redis\", \"check_module\": \"redisdb\", \"pattern\": {\"comm\": \"redis-server\"}, \"conf\": { \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": \"6379\", \"password\": \"protected\"} }] }'\n\ndocker run --name redis -v \/tmp\/redis.conf:\/etc\/redis.conf -e SYSDIG_AGENT_CONF=\"${PER_CONTAINER_CONF}\" -d redis \/etc\/redis.conf Metrics Limit Metric limits are defined by your payment plan. If more metrics are needed please contact your sales representative with your use case. Note that a metric with the same name but different tag name will count as a unique metric by the agent. Example: a metric 'user.clicks' with the tag 'country=us' and another 'user.clicks' with the 'tag country=it' are considered two metrics which count towards the limit. Supported Applications Below is the supported list of applications the agent will automatically poll. Some app-check scripts will need to be configured since no defaults exist, while some applications may need to be configured to output their metrics.

You do not need to add anything on the Kafka instance. Sysdig Agent Configuration Review how to Edit dragent.yaml to Integrate or Modify Application Checks . Metrics from Kafka via JMX polling are already configured in the agent's default-settings configuration file. Metrics for consumers, however, need to use app-checks to poll the Kafka and Zookeeper API. You need to provide consumer names and topics in dragent.yaml file. Default Configuration Since consumer names and topics are environment-specific, a default configuration is not present in dragent.default.yaml . Refer to the following examples for adding Kafka checks to dragent.yaml. Remember! Never edit dragent.default.yaml directly; always edit only dragent.yaml . Example 1: Basic Configuration A basic example with sample consumer and topic names: app_checks:\n - name: kafka\n check_module: kafka_consumer\n pattern:\n comm: java\n arg: kafka.Kafka\n conf:\n kafka_connect_str: \"127.0.0.1:9092\" # kafka address, usually localhost as we run the check on the same instance\n zk_connect_str: \"localhost:2181\" # zookeeper address, may be different than localhost\n zk_prefix: \/\n consumer_groups:\n sample-consumer-1: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-1: [0, ] # sample topic name and partitions\n sample-consumer-2: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-2: [0, 1, 2, 3] # sample topic name and partitions Example 2: Store Consumer Group Info (Kafka 9+) From Kafka 9 onwards, you can store consumer group config info inside Kafka itself for better performance. app_checks:\n - name: kafka\n check_module: kafka_consumer\n pattern: \n comm: java\n arg: kafka.Kafka\n conf: \n kafka_connect_str: \"localhost:9092\"\n zk_connect_str: \"localhost:2181\"\n zk_prefix: \/\n kafka_consumer_offsets: true\n consumer_groups: \n sample-consumer-1: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-1: [0, ] # sample topic name and partitions If kafka_consumer_offsets entry is set to true the app check will look for consumer offsets in Kafka. The appcheck will also look in Kafka if zk_connect_str is not set. Example 3: Aggregate Partitions at the Topic Level To enable aggregation of partitions at the topic level, use kafka_consumer_topics with aggregate_partitions = true . In this case the app check will aggregate the lag & offset values at the partition level, reducing the number of metrics collected. Set aggregate_partitions = false to disable metrics aggregation at the partition level. In this case, the appcheck will show lag and offset values for each partition. app_checks:\n - name: kafka\n check_module: kafka_consumer\n pattern: \n comm: java\n arg: kafka.Kafka\n conf: \n kafka_connect_str: \"localhost:9092\"\n zk_connect_str: \"localhost:2181\"\n zk_prefix: \/\n kafka_consumer_offsets: true\n kafka_consumer_topics:\n aggregate_partitions: true\n consumer_groups:\n sample-consumer-1: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-1: [0, ] # sample topic name and partitions\n sample-consumer-2: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-2: [0, 1, 2, 3] # sample topic name and partitions Example 4: Custom Tags Optional tags can be applied to every emitted metric, service check, and\/or event. app_checks:\n - name: kafka\n check_module: kafka_consumer\n pattern: \n comm: java\n arg: kafka.Kafka\n conf: \n kafka_connect_str: \"localhost:9092\"\n zk_connect_str: \"localhost:2181\"\n zk_prefix: \/\n consumer_groups:\n sample-consumer-1: # sample consumer name\n sample-topic-1: [0, ] # sample topic name and partitions\n tags: [\"key_first_tag:value_1\", \"key_second_tag:value_2\", \"key_third_tag:value_3\"]\n\n Metrics Available Kafka Consumer Metrics (App Checks) See Apache Kafka Consumer Metrics .

Never edit dragent.default.yaml directly; always edit only dragent.yaml . Example 1 First you must identify the process pattern ( comm: ). It must match an actively running process for the HTTP check to work. Sysdig recommends the process be the one that is serving the URL being checked.

This setting defaults to GET, though many other HTTP methods are supported, including POST and PUT. data The data option is only available when using the POST method. Data should be included as key-value pairs and will be sent in the body of the request. content_match A string or Python regular expression. The HTTP check will search for this value in the response and will report as DOWN if the string or expression is not found. reverse_content_match When true, reverses the behavior of the content_match option, i.e. the HTTP check will report as DOWN if the string or expression in content_match IS found. (default is false) username & password If your service uses basic authentication, you can provide the username and password here. http_response_status_code A string or Python regular expression for an HTTP status code. This check will report DOWN for any status code that does not match. This defaults to 1xx, 2xx and 3xx HTTP status codes. For example: 401 or 4\\d\\d . include_content When set to true , the check will include the first 200 characters of the HTTP response body in notifications. The default value is false . collect_response_time By default, the check will collect the response time (in seconds) as the metric network.http.response_time . To disable, set this value to false . disable_ssl_validation This setting will skip SSL certificate validation and is enabled by default. If you require SSL certificate validation, set this to false . This option is only used when gathering the response time\/aliveness from the specified endpoint. Note this setting doesn’t apply to the check_certificate_expiration option. ignore_ssl_warning When SSL certificate validation is enabled (see setting above), this setting allows you to disable security warnings. ca_certs This setting allows you to override the default certificate path as specified in init_config check_certificate_expiration When check_certificate_expiration is enabled, the service check will check the expiration date of the SSL certificate. Note that this will cause the SSL certificate to be validated, regardless of the value of the disable_ssl_validation setting. days_warning When check_certificate_expiration is enabled, these settings will raise a warning alert when the SSL certificate is within the specified number of days from expiration. check_hostname When check_certificate_expiration is enabled, this setting will raise a warning if the hostname on the SSL certificate does not match the host of the given URL. headers This parameter allows you to send additional headers with the request. e.g. X-Auth-Token: <AUTH_TOKEN> skip_proxy If set, the check will bypass proxy settings and attempt to reach the check URL directly. This defaults to false . allow_redirects This setting allows the service check to follow HTTP redirects and defaults to true . tags A list of arbitrary tags that will be associated with the check. Metrics Available HTTP metrics concern response time and SSL certificate expiry information. See HTTP Metrics . Service Checks http.can_connect: Returns DOWN when any of the following occur: the request to URL times out the response code is 4xx\/5xx, or it doesn’t match the pattern provided in the http_response_status_code the response body does not contain the pattern in content_match reverse_content_match is true and the response body does contain the pattern in content_match URI contains https and disable_ssl_validation is false , and the SSL connection cannot be validated Otherwise, returns UP. Segmentation of the http.can_connect can be done by URL. http.ssl_cert: The check returns: DOWN if the URL's certificate has already expired WARNING if the URL's certificate expires in less than days_warning days Otherwise, returns UP.

NGINX Plus has exclusive enterprise‑grade features beyond what's available in the open source offering, including session persistence, configuration via API, and active health checks. The Sysdig agent has a default configuration to collect metrics for open-source NGINX, provided that you have the HTTP stub status module enabled. NGINX exposes basic metrics about server activity on a simple status page with this status module. If NGINX Plus is installed, a wide range of metrics are available with the NGINX Plus API.

The Sysdig agent will not collect metrics until the required endpoint is added to the NGINX configuration, per one of the following methods: For NGINX (Open Source): use the stub status module For NGINX Plus: use the Plus API Configuration examples of each are provided below NGINX Stub Status Module Configuration The ngx_http_stub_status_module provides access to basic status information. It is compiled by default on most distributions. If not, it should be enabled with the --with-http_stub_status_module configuration parameter. To check if the module is already compiled, run the following command: \nnginx -V 2>&1 | grep -o with-http_stub_status_module If with-http_stub_status_module is listed, the status module is enabled. (For more information, see http:\/\/nginx.org\/en\/docs\/http\/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html .) Update the NGINX configuration file with \/nginx_status endpoint as follows.

"body" : " Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application-layer protocol used to manage and monitor network devices and their functions. The Sysdig agent can connect to network devices and collect metrics using SNMP. This page describes the default configuration settings, how to edit the configuration to collect additional information, the metrics available for integration, and a sample result in the Sysdig Monitor UI. SNMP Overview SNMP Agent Configuration Sysdig Agent Configuration Default Configuration Example 1 Metrics Available Result in the Monitor UI SNMP Overview Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard protocol for collecting and configuring information about devices in the networks. The network devices include physical devices like switches, routers, servers etc. SNMP has three primary versions ( SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3) and SNMPv2c is most widely used. SNMP allows device vendors to expose management data in the form of variables on managed systems organized in a management information base (MIB), which describe the system status and configuration. The devices can be queried as well as configured remotely using these variables. Certain MIBs are generic and supported by the majority of the device vendors. Additionally, each vendor can have their own private\/enterprise MIBs for vendor-specific information. SNMP MIB is a collection of objects uniquely identified by an Object Identifier (OID). OIDs are represented in the form of x.0, where x is the name of object in the MIB definition. \nFor example, suppose one wanted to identify an instance of the variable sysDescr \n\nThe object class for sysDescr is: \n\niso org dod internet mgmt mib system sysDescr \n 1 3 6 1 2 1 1 1\n\nHence, the object type, x, would be 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1 SNMP Agent Configuration To monitor the servers with the Sysdig agent, the SNMP agent must be installed on the servers to query the system information. For Ubuntu-based servers, use the following commands to install the SNMP Daemon: $sudo apt-get update\n$sudo apt-get install snmpd Next, configure this SNMP agent to respond to queries from the SNMP manager by updating the configuration file located at \/etc\/snmp\/snmpd.conf Below are the important fields that must be configured: snmpd.conf \n# Listen for connections on all interfaces (both IPv4 *and* IPv6)\nagentAddress udp:161,udp6:[::1]:161\n\n## ACCESS CONTROL\n## system + hrSystem groups only\nview systemonly included .1.3.6.1.2.1.1\nview systemonly included .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1\nview systemonly included .1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1\nview systemonly included .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1\n\n# Default access to basic system info\nrocommunity public default -V systemonly\n# rocommunity6 is for IPv6\nrocommunity6 public default -V systemonly After making changes to the config file, restart the snmpd service using: $sudo service snmpd restart Sysdig Agent Configuration Review how to Edit dragent.yaml to Integrate or Modify Application Checks . Default Configuration No default configuration is present for SNMP check. You must specify the OID\/MIB for every parameter you want to collect, as in the following example. The OIDs configured in dragent.yaml are included in the snmpd.conf configuration under the 'ACCESS CONTROL' section Ensure that the community_string is same as configured in the system configuration ( rocommunity ). Remember! Never edit dragent.default.yaml directly; always edit only dragent.yaml . Example 1 app_checks:\n - name: snmp\n pattern:\n comm: python\n arg: \/opt\/draios\/bin\/sdchecks\n interval: 30\n conf:\n mibs_folder: \/usr\/share\/mibs\/ietf\/\n ip_address: 52.53.158.103\n port: 161\n community_string: public\n\n # Only required for snmp v1, will default to 2\n # snmp_version: 2 \n\n # Optional tags can be set with each metric\n tags:\n - vendor:EMC\n - array:VNX5300\n - location:front\n\n metrics:\n - OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.5\n name: hrStorageSize\n - OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7\n name: sysServices\n - MIB: TCP-MIB\n symbol: tcpActiveOpens\n - MIB: UDP-MIB\n symbol: udpInDatagrams\n - MIB: IP-MIB\n table: ipSystemStatsTable\n symbols:\n - ipSystemStatsInReceives\n metric_tags:\n - tag: ipversion\n index: 1 # specify which index you want to read the tag value from\n - MIB: IF-MIB\n table: ifTable\n symbols:\n - ifInOctets\n - ifOutOctets\n metric_tags:\n - tag: interface\n column: ifDescr # specify which column to read the tag value from\n\n The Sysdig agent allows you to monitor the SNMP counters and gauge of your choice. For each device, specify the metrics that you want to monitor in the metrics subsection using one of the following methods: Specify a MIB and the symbol that you want to export metrics:\n - MIB: UDP-MIB\n symbol: udpInDatagrams Specify an OID and the name you want the metric to appear under in Sysdig Monitor: metrics:\n - OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.5\n name: tcpActiveOpens\n#The name here is the one specified in the MIB but you could use any name. Specify an MIB and a table from which to extract information: metrics:\n - MIB: IF-MIB\n table: ifTable\n symbols:\n - ifInOctets\n metric_tags:\n - tag: interface\n column: ifDescr Metrics Available The SNMP check does not have default metrics. All metrics mentioned in dragent.yaml file will be seen with snmp.* prefix\/ Result in the Monitor UI " },

Currently, Andy Dalton has proposed a solution and we are in process of validating the same.> Oracle Database 12c is a next-generation database providing a new multi-tenant architecture on top of a fast, scalable, reliable, and secure database platform. If OracleDB is installed on your environment, you need to install and integrate Oracle instant client with Sydig. This page describes the installation steps for Oracle Instant Client, configuration settings, the metrics available for integration, and a sample result in the Sysdig Monitor UI. Oracle Setup Oracle Instant Client Installation Download the Client Create a User in Oracle DB for Sysdig Agent Sysdig Agent Configuration Set Up Sysdig Agent With Oracle Libraries Install Sysdig agent with Oracle Instant Client Libraries (For Docker users only) Default Configuration Example 1 Metrics Available Oracle Setup Oracle Instant Client Installation The Oracle app check requires Oracle Instant Client libraries. When Oracle DB is installed as a container, it is necessary to install these dependencies on the host separately to make them available to the Sysdig agent. When Oracle DB is installed as a process, these dependencies will be installed with Oracle. In that case, you can provide the path of the installation directory to the Sysdig agent by editing dragent.yaml . Because Oracle Instant Client is a licensed product, Sysdig is unable to include the libraries with the Sysdig agent. Download the Client Download Oracle Instant Client from the official Oracle website. You must download and install the packages below. An Oracle login is required. oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm oracle-instantclient12.2-devel-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm oracle-instantclient12.2-sqlplus-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm Create a User in Oracle DB for Sysdig Agent Once Oracle DB is ready, run the following commands to create a user: alter session set \"_ORACLE_SCRIPT\"=true; \nCREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED BY <password>; \nGRANT CONNECT TO <username>; \nGRANT SELECT ON gv_$sysmetric TO <username>; \nGRANT SELECT ON sys.dba_data_files TO <username>; Sysdig Agent Configuration Set Up Sysdig Agent With Oracle Libraries After installing Oracle instant Client, you need to link it with Sysdig agent. Install Sysdig agent with Oracle Instant Client Libraries (For Docker users only) If you are installing Sysdig agent as a docker container, a volume must to be mounted in the container with the directory where the Oracle Instant Client is present. Verify that file \"libclntsh.so\" is present at the given path. It may differ based on environment. Examples: When Oracle Instant Client is installed separately, it will be installed at: \"\/usr\/lib\/oracle\/12.2\/client64\/lib \". Volume Mounted: -v \/usr\/lib\/oracle\/12.2\/client64:\/usr\/lib\/oracle\/12.2\/client64 \ndocker run -d --name sysdig-agent --restart always --privileged --net host --pid host -e ACCESS_KEY=XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX -e TAGS=some_tag:some_value -v \/var\/run\/docker.sock:\/host\/var\/run\/docker.sock -v \/dev:\/host\/dev -v \/proc:\/host\/proc:ro -v \/boot:\/host\/boot:ro -v \/lib\/modules:\/host\/lib\/modules:ro -v \/usr:\/host\/usr:ro -v \/usr\/lib\/oracle\/12.2\/client64:\/usr\/lib\/oracle\/12.2\/client64 --shm-size=350m sysdig\/agent When Oracle is installed as a process on the host, it is present at: \"\/u01\/app\/oracle\/product\/12.1.0.2\/db_1\/lib\" .

If the Sysdig agent is installed inside the Docker container, run ldconfig commands inside the container. Provide the library location in the ld configuration file. (Verify that file \" libclntsh.so \" is present at given path.) Run ldconfig . Example: \necho \/u01\/app\/oracle\/product\/12.1.0.2\/db_1\/lib\/ > \/etc\/ld.so.conf.d\/oracle.conf\nldconfig Make sure libaio or libaio1 packege is installed in your environment Default Configuration Review how to Edit dragent.yaml to Integrate or Modify Application Checks . There is no default configuration for OracleDB, as a unique user and password are required for metrics polling. You must add the entry for OracleDB into dragent.yaml. Remember! Never edit dragent.default.yaml directly; always edit only dragent.yaml . Example 1 Confirm the \"comm\" value using the command: cat \/proc\/<pid>\/comm Replace <username> and <password> with username and password created for sysdig agent. Update service_name if different service name is used. services can be listed with command: lsnrctl status Update ORACLE_HOME with the value of the ORACLE_HOME environment variable (from oracle user) or with the installation directory of Oracle DB app_checks:\n - name: oracle\n check_module: oracle\n pattern:\n comm: \"tnslsnr\"\n conf:\n server: localhost\n user: <username>\n password: <password>\n service_name: cdb1\n envs:\n ORACLE_HOME: \/u01\/app\/oracle\/product\/12.1.0.2\/db_1\n log_errors: true Metrics Available Metric Name Metric Description oracle.buffer_cachehit_ratio (gauge) Ratio of buffer cache hits shown as fraction oracle.cursor_cachehit_ratio (gauge) Ratio of cursor cache hits shown as fraction oracle.library_cachehit_ratio (gauge) Ratio of library cache hits shown as fraction oracle.shared_pool_free (gauge) shared pool free memory % shown as percent oracle.physical_reads (gauge) physical reads per sec shown as read oracle.physical_writes (gauge) physical writes per sec shown as write oracle.enqueue_timeouts (gauge) enqueue timeouts per sec shown as timeout oracle.gc_cr_block_received (gauge) GC CR block received shown as block oracle.cache_blocks_corrupt (gauge) corrupt cache blocks shown as block oracle.cache_blocks_lost (gauge) lost cache blocks shown as block oracle.logons (gauge) number of logon attempts oracle.active_sessions (gauge) number of active sessions oracle.long_table_scans (gauge) number of long table scans per sec shown as scan oracle.service_response_time (gauge) service response time shown as second oracle.user_rollbacks (gauge) number of user rollbacks shown as operation oracle.sorts_per_user_call (gauge) sorts per user call oracle.rows_per_sort (gauge) rows per sort shown as row oracle.disk_sorts (gauge) disk sorts per second shown as operation oracle.memory_sorts_ratio (gauge) memory sorts ratio shown as fraction oracle.database_wait_time_ratio (gauge) memory sorts per second shown as fraction oracle.session_limit_usage (gauge) session limit usage shown as percent oracle.session_count (gauge) session count oracle.temp_space_used (gauge) temp space used shown as byte oracle.tablespace.used (gauge) tablespace used shown as byte oracle.tablespace.size (gauge) tablespace size shown as byte oracle.tablespace.in_use (gauge) tablespace in-use shown as fraction Result in the Monitor UI " },

"body" : "Application checks are integrations that allow the Sysdig agent to poll specific metrics exposed by any application, and the built-in app checks currently supported are listed on the App Checks main page . Many other Java-based applications are also supported out-of-the-box. If your application is not already supported though, you have a few options: Utilize Prometheus, StatsD, or JMX to collect custom metrics: Prometheus integrations JMX integrations StatsD integrations Send a request at support@sysdig.com , and we'll do our best to add support for your application. Create your own check by following the instructions below. If you do write a custom check, let us know. We love hearing about how our users extend Sysdig Monitor, and we can also consider embedding your app check automatically in the Sysdig agent. See also Understanding the Agent Config Files for details on accessing and editing the agent configuration files in general. Contents Check Anatomy Check Interface Detail Testing Check Anatomy Essentially, an app check is a Python Class that extends AgentCheck : from checks import AgentCheck\n\nclass MyCustomCheck(AgentCheck):\n # namespaces of the monitored process to join\n # right now we support 'net', 'mnt' and 'uts'\n # put there the minimum necessary namespaces to join\n # usually 'net' is enough. In this case you can also omit the variable\n # NEEDED_NS = ( 'net', )\n\n # def __init__(self, name, init_config, agentConfig):\n # '''\n # Optional, define it if you need custom initialization\n # remember to accept these parameters and pass them to the superclass\n # '''\n # AgentCheck.__init__(self, name, init_config, agentConfig)\n # self.myvar = None\n\n def check(self, instance):\n '''\n This function gets called to perform the check.\n Connect to the application, parse the metrics and add them to aggregation using\n superclass methods like `self.gauge(metricname, value, tags)`\n '''\n server_port = instance['port']\n self.gauge(\"testmetric\", 1) Put this file into \/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/checks.custom.d (create the directory if not present) and it will be available to the Sysdig agent. To run your checks, you need to supply configuration information in the agent's config file, dragent.yaml as is done with bundled checks: app_checks:\n - name: voltdb # check name, must be unique\n # name of your .py file, if it's the same of the check name you can omit it\n # check_module: voltdb \n pattern: # pattern to match the application\n comm: java\n arg: org.voltdb.VoltDB\n conf:\n port: 21212 # any key value config you need on `check(self, instance_conf)` function Check Interface Detail As you can see, the most important piece of the check interface is the check function. The function declaration is: def check(self, instance) instance is a dict containing the configuration of the check. It will contain all the attributes found in the conf: section in dragent.yaml plus the following: name : The check unique name. ports : An array of all listening ports of the process. port : The first listening port of the process. These attributes are available as defaults and allow you to automatically configure your check. The conf: section as higher priority on these values. Inside the check function you can call these methods to send metrics: \nself.gauge(metric_name, value, tags) # Sample a gauge metric\n\nself.rate(metric_name, value, tags) # Sample a point, with the rate calculated at the end of the check\n\nself.increment(metric_name, value, tags) # Increment a counter metric\n\nself.decrement(metric_name, value, tags) # Decrement a counter metric\n\nself.histogram(metric_name, value, tags) # Sample a histogram metric\n\nself.count(metric_name, value, tags) # Sample a raw count metric\n\nself.monotonic_count(metric_name, value, tags) # Sample an increasing counter metric Usually the most used are gauge and rate . Besides metric_name and value parameters that are quite obvious, you can also add tags to your metric using this format: \ntags = [ \"key:value\", \"key2:value2\", \"key_without_value\"] It is an array of string representing tags in both single or key\/value approach. They will be useful in Sysdig Monitor for graph segmentation. You can also send service checks which are on\/off metrics, using this interface: self.service_check(name, status, tags) Where status can be: AgentCheck.OK AgentCheck.WARNING AgentCheck.CRITICAL AgentCheck.UNKNOWN Testing To test your check you can launch Sysdig App Checks from the command line to avoid running the full agent and iterate faster: # from \/opt\/draios directory\nsudo .\/bin\/sdchecks runCheck <check_unique_name> <process_pid> [<process_vpid>] [<process_port>] check_unique_name : The check name as on config file. pid : Process pid seen from host. vpid : Optional, process pid seen inside the container, defaults to 1. port : Optional, port where the process is listening, defaults to None. Example: sudo .\/bin\/sdchecks runCheck redis 1254 1 6379\n5658:INFO:Starting\n5658:INFO:Container support: True\n5658:INFO:Run AppCheck for {'ports': [6379], 'pid': 5625, 'check': 'redis', 'vpid': 1}\nConf: {'port': 6379, 'socket_timeout': 5, 'host': '127.0.0.1', 'name': 'redis', 'ports': [6379]}\nMetrics: # metrics array\nChecks: # metrics check\nException: None # exceptions The output is intentionally raw to allow you to better debug what the check is doing.

"body" : "Sysdig supports adding custom application check-script configurations for each individual container in the infrastructure. This avoids multiple edits and entries to achieve container specific customization. In particular, this enables PaaS to work smarter, by delegating application teams to configure their own checks. See also Understanding the Agent Config Files for details on accessing and editing the agent configuration files in general. Contents How It Works Example with Dockerfile Example with Docker CLI How It Works The SYSDIG_AGENT_CONF variable stores a YAML-formatted configuration for your app check and will be used to match app check configurations. All original app_checks are available, and the syntax is the same as for dragent.yaml. You can add the environment variable directly to theDocker file. Example with Dockerfile This example defines a per container app-check for redis. Normally you would have a yaml formatted entry installed into the agent's \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml file that would look like this: app_checks: \n - name: redis\n check_module: redisdb\n pattern:\n comm: redis-server\n conf:\n host: 127.0.0.1\n port: \"{port}\"\n password: protected For the per-container method, convert and add the above entry to the Docker file via the SYSDIG_AGENT_CONF environment variable: FROM redis\n# This config file adds a password for accessing redis instance\nADD redis.conf \/\n\nENV SYSDIG_AGENT_CONF { \"app_checks\": [{ \"name\": \"redis\", \"check_module\": \"redisdb\", \"pattern\": {\"comm\": \"redis-server\"}, \"conf\": { \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": \"6379\", \"password\": \"protected\"} }] }\nENTRYPOINT [\"redis-server\"]\nCMD [ \"\/redis.conf\" ] Example with Docker CLI You can add parameters starting a container with dockerrunusing-e\/--envflag or injecting it using orchestration systems like Kubernetes: \nPER_CONTAINER_CONF='{ \"app_checks\": [{ \"name\": \"redis\", \"check_module\": \"redisdb\", \"pattern\": {\"comm\": \"redis-server\"}, \"conf\": { \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": \"6379\", \"password\": \"protected\"} }] }'\n\ndocker run --name redis -v \/tmp\/redis.conf:\/etc\/redis.conf -e SYSDIG_AGENT_CONF=\"${PER_CONTAINER_CONF}\" -d redis \/etc\/redis.conf " },

For more information on user permissions, refer to the User section of the Platform docs. To share a dashboard: Navigate to the Dashboards tab. Select the dashboard from the left hand panel. Select the Settings (three dots) icon and click Share . Toggle the Share with Team slider to share the dashboard with the current team. Copy a Dashboard to a Team Unlike sharing a dashboard, copying a dashboard creates a duplicate, rather than making the original dashboard available for editing\/viewing. To copy a dashboard: Navigate to the Dashboards tab. Select the dashboard from the left hand panel. Click the Settings icon, and select Copy Dashboard from the drop-down list. Select either Current Team or Other Team(s) to copy the dashboard to those teams. If copy the dashboard to a different team, open the drop-down menu and select the relevant checkbox. Multiple teams can be selected with this option. Rename the dashboard if desired. Click the Copy and Open \/ Send Copy button to save the changes. Share a Dashboard via Public URL Dashboards can be shared outside of the internal team by using public URLs. This allows external users to review the dashboard metrics, while restricting access to changing panels and configurations. To share a dashboard: Navigate to the Dashboards tab. Select the dashboard from the left hand panel. Select the Settings icon and click Share . Toggle the Share Public URL slider to reveal the custom public URL. When enabled, the dashboard is visible in read-only mode to anyone with the link. If this setting is disabled, the link will no longer work, and the setting will need to be re-enabled and shared again in order for the dashboard to be accessed. Copy the public URL to share it.

"body" : "Sysdig Monitor provides users the ability to save existing dashboards to a locally controlled file, and create new dashboards identical to the ones previously saved. This can be done via Sysdig's Python client library example scripts. The save script stores all current dashboards for the active account in a .zip archive, while the restore script adds all dashboards in the archive to the list of dashboards. Restoring dashboards will not override the user's existing dashboards. Instead, new dashboards will be added to the list. If this script is used in a strictly backup\/restore capacity, dashboards will need to be deleted manually from the account, either before or after the restore action is completed. The restore script does not have to target the same account as the save script. This allows dashboards to be saved from one user, and restored to multiple users. Saving and restoring the scripts has the following prerequisites: Python 2.x (2.7.x) pip version 1.3 or later. pip is installed as part of the Python package for versions 2.7 and later. virtualenv (recommended) The library and example scripts are available in the Sysdig GitHub repository: https:\/\/github.com\/draios\/python-sdc-client .

Cassandra Overview This view shows how a Cassandra cluster is performing, by mixing key system metrics with Cassandra-specific metrics such as requests volume and compactions. Use this view on a group containing the entire Cassandra cluster as a first starting point to troubleshoot the overall health of your database. Inspect typical system metrics to make sure the cluster is not being overloaded Correlate the information displayed with important advanced Cassandra metrics such as pending compactions or JVM metrics to identify critical problems. HTTP Top Requests This view details the top requested URLs to your web server, including the total number of requests, average and maximum times to service the requests, and the amount of traffic contained in the requests and responses. MongoDB This view shows the how busy the MongoDB service is, which collections are in highest demand and which have the slowest performance. Use to spot which collections may benefit from query and index performance tuning. HTTP This view provides a basic understanding of the health of your web server by showing the load being put on it and the server's ability to service requests in a timely manner. Gauge the overall busyness of the server. Identify correlations between the Top URLs and Slowest URLs panels to find opportunities to increase performance.

Scaling line width is relative to the metric values associated with each link. Topology View dynamically adjusts the legend as the data recorded for each connection changes. The thin black line(—): Lower metric values. The thick black line( — ): Higher metric values. Dashed lines(---): The connections between nodes where no Sysdig Agent is installed. The color scheme is determined by color coding for the customizable threshold. The nodes are identified by five colors: GREEN The node is healthy. YELLOW The node is in a warning state.

"body" : "For policy events local to the environment, the first step to address them is by adding custom Falco rules via the Rules Editor tab of the Policies module. These additions will extend or overwrite the behavior of a list, macro, or rule from the default rules section, in order to address the false positive. A number of rules have a macro with the prefix user_, that can be overridden in the custom rules section in order to change the behavior of a rule. Some examples include: user_known_write_etc_conditions user_read_sensitive_file_conditions user_known_change_thread_namespace_binaries user_shell_container_exclusions user_trusted_containers user_sensitive_mount_containers If a user_ macro is not available, Sysdig recommends appending changes to an existing list, macro, or rule, instead of overwriting them. Overwritten lists, macros, and rules will remain static when the default rules are updated. This could lead to new default rules being shadowed and inaccessible to the user. The specific changes necessary to the Falco rules depend heavily on the policy that triggered the false positives. A few examples are shown below: Write below etc For the Write Below etc policy, there may be an additional program that writes specific file(s) below \/etc (this example uses the program catsd , and the file \/etc\/catfood.cfg ). A macro could then be defined as follows: - macro: catsd_writing_catfood_cfg\n condition: (proc.name=catsd and fd.name=\/etc\/catfood.cfg) In addition, the macro user_known_write_etc_conditions would need to be overwritten to add a new exception: - macro: user_known_write_etc_conditions\n condition: catsd_writing_catfood_cfg Launch Privileged Container For the Launch Privileged Container policy, there may be a specific container that must run with privileges. The example macro below uses images starting with registry.customer.com\/mydatastore , and overrides the user_trusted_containers macro: - macro: user_trusted_containers\n condition: (container.image startswith registry.customer.com\/mydatastore) Run shelluntrusted For the Run shelluntrusted policy, a program may be present that spawns shells in the environment for legitimate purposes. The example below appends php to the list of known shell spawn binaries, using the user_known_shell_spawn_binaries list: - list: user_known_shell_spawn_binaries\n append: true\n items: [php] For more information on creating Falco rules, refer to the Falco Rules documentation.

"body" : "The example walkthrough below covers modifying a policy and the underlying rules to whitelist a container, in order to minimize false positive results. Identify the Container \/ Image to Whitelist The container\/image can be identified either from the Sysdig Secure UI (if an event has already been triggered), or directly from the host. From the Sysdig Secure UI To find the container \/ image: From the Policy Events module, use the left-hand drill-down menu to identify the object to whitelist. In this example, the desired object is one of the built-in Kubernetes components (k8s_kube-addon-manager): Using the drill-down menu is not strictly necessary, as all of the information is contained within the Policy Event Details window. However, using the drill-down menu can help verify the correct object to whitelist. Click on the relevant event to open the Policy Event Details window to review the event details, and identify the object to be whitelisted. In this example, the image is a sha256 digest as it is an internal component of Kubernetes, so the container name should be used instead, in case the component is upgraded at a later date. A variety of metadata can be used for whitelisting. For containers, container name, image name, or digest could be used. Container name is the most common approach, but this option could be spoofed. Image name (such as sysdig\/agent) is a more secure option. Using the digest is the most secure option as the source is guaranteed, but may require an automated solution to ensure the platform continues to whitelist the object correctly after component updates. Identify the name of the policy rule triggered by the object: From the Host CLI To find the container \/ image: In a terminal on the host, run the following command: The example command below limits the output of docker ps to only provide the relevant information, as it is only seeking the container name or source image. \nuser@host:~$ docker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Image}}\" For larger lists, either use more|less or grep to find the specific object. In the example output below, grep is used to find addon , as the desired image is k8s_kube-addon-manager . The command also includes the table headings: \nuser@host:~$ docker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Image}}\" | grep 'addon\\|NAME' | more\nNAMES IMAGE\nk8s_kube-addon-manager_kube-addon-manager-minikube_kube-system_8b52f08746ac78d32737b5f7fdffec52_3 9c16409588eb\nk8s_POD_kube-addon-manager-minikube_kube-system_8b52f08746ac78d32737b5f7fdffec52_3 k8s.gcr.io\/pause-amd64:3.1 Identify the policy rule violated. This can only be done via the Sysdig Secure UI. Add the Whitelist Rule The default Falco rules within Sysdig Secure are read-only. To modify a rule, rewrite it as a custom rule: From the Policies module, navigate to the Rules Editor tab. Define the macro by either creating a new macro, or editing an existing macro: This example edits an existing macro. The process is the same for creating a new macro, but requires a unique name. Find the existing macro in the Default Rules section, and copy it into the Custom Rules section Add a condition to the macro that defines the object to be whitelisted: Find the existing default rule, and determine if it uses the user_trusted containers macro: In this example, Write below root does not use the user_trusted_containers macro. Copy the rule to the Custom Rules section. Add the configured macro to the rule: Click the Save button to save the changes. The updated rule will be available the next time the Sysdig Agent checks into the back-end (usually every 10 seconds or so). Check Policy Events are Cleared Once the policy has been applied and the events are cleared from being notified, the whitelisted object should show either No events found , or with this policy no longer triggered: " },

Define the policy scope within the infrastructure, and whether the policy applies to hosts and\/or containers. Define the actions that should occur when the policy is triggered: Set the container action to Nothing (no change will occur, but a event notification will be sent), Stop (the container will be killed), or Pause (the container will be paused for review). Optional: Check the Captures checkbox to enable capture creation, and define the time before and after the event the capture file should record.

The New Registry page is displayed. Enter the Path to the registry. E.g. docker.io . Select the registry Type from the drop-down menu. Configure the registry-specific credentials (based on the Type chosen): Docker V2 There are many Docker V2 registries, and the credential requirements may differ. For example, for Azure Container Registry: Admin Account Username : in the 'az acr credentials show --name <registry name>' command result Password : The password or password2 value from the 'az acr credentials show' command result Service Principal Username : The service principal app id Password : The service principal password AWS ECR: AWS access key AWS secret key Google Container Registry: JSON Key (Primarily for OpenShift clusters): Add an internal registry address . The recommended way to run an image registry for an OpenShift cluster is to run it locally. The Sysdig agent will detect the internal registry names, but for the Anchore engine to pull and scan the image it needs access to the internal registry itself. Example: External name: mytestregistry.example.com Internal name: docker-registry.default.svc:5000 Sysdig maps the internal registry name to the external registry name, so the Runtime and Repository lists will show only the external names. Optional: Toggle the switch to Allow Self-Signed certificates. By default, the UI will only pull images from a TLS\/SSL-enabled registry. Toggle Allow Self-Signed to instruct the UI not to validate the certificate (if the registry is protected with a self-signed certificate or a cert from an unknown certificate authority). Optional: Toggle the Test Credentials switch to validate your entries. When enabled, Sysdig will attempt to pull the image using the entered credentials. If it succeeds, the registry will be saved. If it fails, you will receive an error and can correct the credentials or image details.

Each scanning policy is comprised of rules built of gates and triggers . Sysdig includes default policies that can be used to run scans as soon as registry credentials have been configured. Users can create additional rules or policies from the available **Scanning Policy Gates and Triggers** . Contents Preconfigured Policies Default Policy Preconfigured Compliance Policies Configuration Policy - Dockerfile Best Practices Audit Policy - NIST 800-190 Audit Policy - PCI Customized Policies Create a New Policy Edit an Existing Policy Delete an Existing Policy Whitelist\/Blacklist Manage Policy Assignments Assign a Policy Example Use Cases Using Priorities Preconfigured Policies Sysdig provides four baseline policies that can be used as-is or as templates on which to build. Default Policy This policy covers the most common image scanning cases, such as: checking for medium and high vulnerabilities checking configuration items (e.g., ensuring health checks in an image or disallowing exposed ports) validating that the vulnerability feed data is up-to-date. This policy is a basic catch-all that cannot be deleted. If no other policy assignments are made, the Default policy is automatically used. You can edit the Default policy and edits will be retained even when you upgrade Sysdig Secure. Preconfigured Compliance Policies The three other preconfigured policies deal with compliance rules. To use them, you must add them to the Policy Assignments list . If you want to edit a preconfigured compliance policy, create a new policy with matching rules and edit that. Otherwise, your customizations may be overwritten and lost during Sysdig Secure upgrades. Configuration Policy - Dockerfile Best Practices This policy provides out-of-the-box rules around Dockerfile best practices , such as disallowing: secrets baked in as environment variables root user configuration exposed ports run instructions that include .yum upgrades. Audit Policy - NIST 800-190 This policy maps NIST 800-190 controls to a Sysdig Secure scanning policy, such as disallowing: non-official node or Ruby packages add instructions in a Docker file the use of base distributions outside of expected values. Audit Policy - PCI This policy maps PCI (Payment Card Industry) controls to a Sysdig Secure scanning policy, such as disallowing vulnerabilities or credentials to be included in the image. Customized Policies Remember not to edit preconfigured compliance scanning policies directly. Create a matching policy and edit that one. Create a New Policy From the Image Scanning module, select Scanning Policies and click Add Policy(+) . The New Policy page is displayed. Define a Name and an optional Description for the new policy. Add a Rule : Select the Gate and then the Trigger from the drop-down menus. Configure relevant parameters. (Some triggers do not require parameters to be set.) See **Scanning Policy Gates and Triggers** for details on each option. The example below uses the vulnerabilities gate with the package trigger. Optional: Repeat step 5 to add rules as necessary. Click Save . Edit an Existing Policy To edit an existing scanning policy: From the Image Scanning module, select Scanning Policies . Select the desired policy from the list. Edit the policy rules as required, and click Save Policy . Delete an Existing Policy To delete an existing scanning policy: From the Image Scanning module, select Scanning Policies . Select the desired policy from the list. Click the Delete (trash can) icon and choose Yes to confirm the change. Whitelist\/Blacklist You can globally whitelist or blacklist particular images or CVEs, if desired. See **Whitelist | Blacklist CVEs and Images** . This does not affect the policy evaluation order. Manage Policy Assignments Unless you use a very simple, single-policy approach to scanning, you will probably assign particular policies to particular registries, repos, or tags. Use the Policy Assignments page to do so. Assign a Policy From the Image Scanning module, select Scanning Policies and choose Policy Assignments . The previously defined assignments are listed in priority order. Click +Add Policy Assignment . A new entry line appears at the top of the Assignment page. Enter the desired assignment details: Priority : Priority is the order of evaluation against the assigned policy. Each new assignment is auto-placed at Priority 1. Once a policy assignment is created and saved, you can change its priority order by dragging it into a new position on the list. See also Using Priorities . Registry : Any registry domain (e.g. quay.io). Wildcards are supported; an asterisk * specifies any registry. Repository : Any repository (typically = name of the image). Wildcards are supported; an asterisk * specifies any repository. Tag : Any tag. Wildcards are supported; an asterisk * specifies any tag. Assigned Policy : Name of policy to use for evaluation. Select from the drop-down menu. Click Save . Optional: Reorganize the Priority order by clicking the drag handle (the four dots to the left of a line) and dragging the assignment to a different spot on the list. Example Use Cases To prevent developers from pulling unknown images from a Docker hub, you may want to design a rule for the docker.io registry, (including all repos and tags), and assign an appropriate policy. <Which gate\/ trigger\/policuy checks for unknown images?> \nregistry = docker.io repository = * tags = * assigned policy = ? Organizations commonly tag images as dev or prod . You can apply a tag assignment to dev images by using wildcard.wildcard.dev. Using Priorities When you use more than one scanning policy, the Anchore engine evaluates them in top-down order, starting from Priority 1 in the Policy Assignment list. The first policy assignment rule that matches an input image will be evaluated, and all subsequent rules ignored. Therefore, the priority order is important. For example, imagine a list with two defined policy assignments: Priority 1 Registry = quay.io Repository = sysdig\/* Priority 2 Registry = quay.io Repository = sysdig\/myrepo Since the first rule uses a wild card, the evaluation applies to all repos beginning with sysdig\/ and will stop before evaluating sysdig\/myrepo . Reverse the priority order to get the behavior you want. There is a catch-all entry at the bottom of the Policy Assignment list that cannot be removed. It has the format : \nregistry = * repository = * tag = * assigned policy = default (You can change the assigned policy , but other fields cannot be edited.)

Understanding Report Filters Setting up a Report filter is simple: Choose Custom Selection Choose a benchmark version and apply a Profile filter, and\/or select\/deselect individual controls. Use the information in this section to understand the effect of your selections. About Custom Selections Filtering rules apply to the report, not the test itself. Filtering Rules Filtering the Report view does not change the scope of the test run. The full compliance benchmark will be run, but the result view will be edited. If you apply a filter to an existing task which has already been run, the filter view will be retroactively applied to the historical reports. If you deselect the filter, the full results will again be visible. About Benchmark Versions CIS issues benchmark versions that correspond to – but are not identical with -- the Kubernetes or Docker software version. See the mapping tables, below. Version Rules If you do not customize\/filter your report, the Sysdig agent will auto-detect your environment version and will run the corresponding version of the benchmark controls. If you specify a benchmark version, you can then apply a report filter. If you specify a benchmark test version that doesn't match your environment version, an error message will be displayed. The correct test will be run, but the filter must be removed to see the results correctly. (true??)

"body" : " Introduction Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments Summary of Functionality Configuration Main Config Parameters Process Filter conf Authentication Integration conf Authentication Example Kubernetes Objects Examples Histograms Logging Troubleshooting Legacy Prometheus Application Check Introduction Starting with version 0.70.0, the Sysdig Monitor Agent provides rich support for automatically scraping metrics from Prometheus exporters . This article describes default behaviors and how to further configure the feature to specify which processes and ports should be targeted for scraping. See our blog post for additional context on the Prometheus metric format and how such metrics are typically used. The Sysdig Monitor Agent also had rudimentary Prometheus support in versions older than 0.70.0. If you were using this functionality, see the section below on the Legacy Prometheus Application Check for important upgrade information. Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments Prometheus users who are already leveraging Kubernetes Service Discovery (specifically the approach in this sample prometheus-kubernetes.yml ) may already have Annotations attached to their Pods that mark them as eligible for scraping. Such environments can quickly begin scraping the same metrics using the Sysdig Agent in a couple easy steps. Enable the Prometheus metrics feature in the Sysdig Agent. Assuming you are deploying using DaemonSets , the needed config can be added to the Agent's dragent.yaml by including the following in your DaemonSet YAML (placing it in the env section for the sysdig-agent container): - name: ADDITIONAL_CONF\n value: \"prometheus:\\n enabled: true\"\n\n Ensure the Kubernetes Pods that contain your Prometheus exporters have been deployed with the following Annotations to enable scraping (substituting the listening exporter-TCP-port) : spec:\n template:\n metadata:\n annotations:\n prometheus.io\/scrape: \"true\"\n prometheus.io\/port: \"exporter-TCP-port\" The configuration above assumes your exporters use the typical endpoint called \/metrics . If an exporter is using a different endpoint, this can also be specified by adding the following additional optional Annotation, substituting the exporter-endpoint-name : \nprometheus.io\/path: \"\/exporter-endpoint-name\" If you try this Kubernetes Deployment of a simple exporter , you will quickly see auto-discovered Prometheus metrics being displayed in Sysdig Monitor. You can use this working example as a basis to similarly Annotate your own exporters. If you have Prometheus exporters not deployed in annotated Kubernetes Pods that you would like to scrape, the following sections describe the full set of options to configure the Agent to find and scrape your metrics. Summary of Functionality The Sysdig Monitor Agent uses its visibility to all running processes (at both the host and container levels) to find eligible targets for scraping Prometheus metrics. By default, no scraping is attempted. Once the feature is enabled, the Agent assembles a list of eligible targets in two steps: A process is determined to be eligible for possible scraping if it positively matches against a series of Process Filter include\/exclude rules. The Agent will then attempt to scrape an eligible process at a \/metrics endpoint on all of its listening TCP ports, unless additional configuration is present to restrict scraping to a subset of ports and\/or another endpoint name. The metrics ultimately appear in the Sysdig Monitor Explore interface in the Prometheus section. Within the set of eligible processes\/ports\/endpoints, the Agent uses an auto-discover approach to scrape only ports that are exporting Prometheus metrics, and will stop attempting to scrape or retry on ports based on how they respond to attempts to connect and scrape them. It is therefore strongly recommended that you create a configuration that restricts the process and ports for attempted scraping to the minimum expected range for your exporters. This minimizes the potential for unintended side-effects in both the Agent and your applications due to repeated failed connection attempts. Configuration As is typical for the Agent, the default configuration for the feature is specified in dragent.default.yaml , and you can override the defaults by configuring parameters in the dragent.yaml . For each parameter you do not set in dragent.yaml , the defaults in dragent.default.yaml will remain in effect. Main Config Parameters Parameter Default Description enabled false Turns Prometheus scraping on\/off. interval 10 How often (in seconds) the Agent will scrape a port for Prometheus metrics log_errors true Whether the Agent should log details on failed attempts to scrape eligible targets max_metrics 1000 The maximum number of total Prometheus metrics that will be scraped across all targets. This value of 1000 is the maximum per-Agent, and is a separate limit from other Custom Metrics (e.g. statsd , JMX , and other Application Checks ). max_metrics_per_process 100 The maximum number of Prometheus metrics that the Agent will save from a single scraped target max_tags_per_metric 20 The maximum number of tags per Prometheus metric that the Agent will save from a scraped target histograms false Whether the Agent should scrape and report histogram metrics. See the section below on histograms for details. process_filter See below Specifies which processes may be eligible for scraping. See the Process Filter section below. Process Filter The process_filter section specifies which of the processes known by an Agent may be eligible for scraping. Note that once you specify a process_filter in your dragent.yaml , this replaces the entire Prometheus process_filter section (i.e. all rules) shown in the dragent.default.yaml . The Process Filter is specified in a series of include and exclude rules that are evaluated top-to-bottom for each process known by an Agent. If a process matches an include rule, scraping will be attempted via a \/metrics endpoint on each listening TCP port for the process, unless a conf section also appears within the rule to further restrict how the process will be scraped (see the \"conf\" section below). Multiple patterns can be specified in a single rule, in which case all patterns must match for the rule to be a match (AND logic). Within a pattern value, simple \"glob\" wildcarding may be used, where * matches any number of characters (including none) and ? matches any single character. Note that due to YAML syntax, when using wildcards, be sure to enclose the value in quotes ( \"*\" ). The table below describes the supported patterns in Process Filter rules. To provide realistic examples, we'll use a simple sample Prometheus exporter (source code here ) which can be deployed as a container using the Docker command line below. To help illustrate some of the configuration options, this sample exporter presents Prometheus metrics on \/promtheus instead of the more common \/metrics endpoint, which will be shown in the example configurations further below. # docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \\\n --label class=\"exporter\" \\\n --name my-java-app \\\n luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n \n# ps auxww | grep app.jar\nroot 11502 95.9 9.2 3745724 753632 ? Ssl 15:52 1:42 java -jar \/app.jar --management.security.enabled=false\n \n# curl http:\/\/localhost:8080\/prometheus\n...\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.005\",} 6.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.01\",} 17.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.025\",} 51.0\n... Pattern name Description Example container.image Matches if the process is running inside a container running the specified image - include: container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app container.name Matches if the process is running inside a container with the specified name - include: container.name: my-java-app container.label.* Matches if the process is running in a container that has a Label matching the given value - include: container.label.class: exporter kubernetes.<object>.annotation.* kubernetes.<object>.label.* Matches if the process is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with the Annotation\/Label matching the given value. Note: This pattern does not apply to the Docker-only command-line shown above, but would instead apply if the exporter were installed as a Kubernetes Deployment using this example YAML . Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. - include: kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: true process.name Matches the name of the running process - include: process.name: java process.cmdline Matches a command line argument - include: process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\" port Matches if the process is listening on one or more TCP ports. The pattern for a single rule can specify a single port as shown in this example, or a single range (e.g. 8079-8081 ), but does not support comma-separated lists of ports\/ranges. Note: This parameter is only used to confirm if a process is eligible for scraping based on the ports on which it is listening. For example, if a process is listening on one port for application traffic and has a second port open for exporting Prometheus metrics, it would be possible to specify the application port here (but not the exporting port), and the exporting port in the conf section (but not the application port), and the process would be matched as eligible and the exporting port would be scraped. - include: port: 8080 appcheck.match Matches if an Application Check with the specific name or pattern is scheduled to run for the process. - exclude: appcheck.match: \"*\" Instead of the include examples shown above that would have each matched our process, due to the previously-described ability to combine multiple patterns in a single rule, the following very strict configuration would also have matched: - include:\n container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n container.name: my-java-app\n container.label.class: exporter\n process.name: java\n process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\"\n port: 8080 conf Each include rule in the port_filter may include a conf portion that further describes how scraping will be attempted on the eligible process. If a conf portion is not included, scraping will be attempted at a \/metrics endpoint on all listening ports of the matching process. The possible settings: Parameter name Description Example port Either a static number for a single TCP port to be scraped, or a container\/Kubernetes Label name or Kubernetes Annotation specified in curly braces. If the process is running in a container that is marked with this Label or is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with this Annotation\/Label, scraping will be attempted only on the port specified as the value of the Label\/Annotation. Note: The Label\/Annotation to match against will not include the text shown in red . Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. Note: If running the exporter inside a container, this should specify the port number that the exporter process in the container is listening on, not the port that the container exposes to the host. port: 8080 - or - port: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.port}\" - or - port: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/port}\" port_filter A set of include and exclude rules that define the ultimate set of listening TCP ports for an eligible process on which scraping may be attempted. Note that the syntax is different from the port pattern option from within the higher-level include rule in the process_filter . Here a given rule can include single ports, comma-separated lists of ports (enclosed in square brackets), or contiguous port ranges (without brackets). port_filter: - include: 8080 - exclude: [9092,9200,9300] - include: 9090-9100 path Either the static specification of an endpoint to be scraped, or a container\/Kubernetes Label name or Kubernetes Annotation specified in curly braces. If the process is running in a container that is marked with this Label or is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with this Annotation\/Label, scraping will be attempted via the endpoint specified as the value of the Label\/Annotation. If path is not specified, or specified but the Agent does not find the Label\/Annotation attached to the process, the common Prometheus exporter default of \/metrics will be used. Note: A Label\/Annotation to match against will not include the text shown in red . Note: See the section below on Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. path: \"\/prometheus\" - or - path: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.path}\" - or - path: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/path}\" host A hostname or IP address. The default is localhost. host: 192.168.1.101\n- or -\nhost: subdomain.example.com\n- or -\nhost: localhost use_https When set to true , connectivity to the exporter will only be attempted through HTTPS instead of HTTP. It is false by default. (Available in Agent version 0.79.0 and newer) use_https: true ssl_verify When set to true , verification will be performed for the server certificates for an HTTPS connection. It is false by default. Verification was enabled by default before 0.79.0. (Available in Agent version 0.79.0 and newer) ssl_verify: true Authentication Integration As of agent version 0.89, Sysdig can collect Prometheus metrics from endpoints requiring authentication. Use the parameters below to enable this function. For username\/password authentication: username password For authentication using a token: auth_token_path For certificate authentication with a certificate key: auth_cert_path auth_key_path Token substitution is also supported for all the authorization parameters. For instance a username can be taken from a Kubernetes annotation by specifying username: \"{ kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/username }\" conf Authentication Example Below is an example of the dragent.yaml section showing all the Prometheus authentication configuration options, on OpenShift, Kubernetes, and etcd. In this example: The username\/password are taken from a default annotation used by OpenShift. The auth token path is commonly available in Kubernetes deployments. The certificate and key used here for etcd may normally not be as easily accessible to the agent. In this case they were extracted from the host namespace, constructed into Kubernetes secrets, and then mounted into the agent container. prometheus: \n enabled: true\n process_filter: \n - include: \n port: 1936\n conf: \n username: \"{kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/username}\"\n password: \"{kubernetes.service.annotation.prometheus.openshift.io\/password}\"\n - include: \n process.name: kubelet\n conf: \n port: 10250\n use_https: true\n auth_token_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/kubernetes.io\/serviceaccount\/token\"\n - include: \n process.name: etcd\n conf: \n port: 2379\n use_https: true\n auth_cert_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/etcd\/client-cert\"\n auth_key_path: \"\/run\/secrets\/etcd\/client-key\" Kubernetes Objects As described above, there are multiple configuration options that can be set based on auto-discovered values for Kubernetes Labels and\/or Annotations. The format in each case begins with \"kubernetes.OBJECT.annotation.\" or \"kubernetes.OBJECT.label.\" where OBJECT can be any of the following supported Kubernetes object types: daemonSet deployment namespace node pod replicaSet replicationController service statefulset The configuration text you add after the final dot becomes the name of the Kubernetes Label\/Annotation that the Agent will look for. If the Label\/Annotation is discovered attached to the process, the value of that Label\/Annotation will be used for the configuration option. Note that there are multiple ways for a Kubernetes Label\/Annotation to be attached to a particular process. One of the simplest examples of this is the Pod-based approach shown above in the Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments . However, as an example alternative to marking at the Pod level, you could attach Labels\/Annotations at the Namespace level, in which case auto-discovered configuration options would apply to all processes running in that Namespace regardless of whether they're in a Deployment, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, etc. Examples As an example that pulls together many of the configuration elements shown above, consider the default Agent configuration that's inherited from the dragent.default.yaml . prometheus:\n enabled: false\n interval: 10\n log_errors: true\n max_metrics: 1000\n max_metrics_per_process: 100\n max_tags_per_metric: 20\n \n # Filtering processes to scan. Processes not matching a rule will not\n # be scanned\n # If an include rule doesn't contain a port or port_filter in the conf\n # section, we will scan all the ports that a matching process is listening to.\n process_filter:\n - exclude:\n process.name: docker-proxy\n - exclude:\n container.image: sysdig\/agent\n # special rule to exclude processes matching configured prometheus appcheck\n - exclude:\n appcheck.match: prometheus\n - include:\n container.label.io.prometheus.scrape: \"true\"\n conf:\n # Custom path definition\n # If the Label doesn't exist we'll still use \"\/metrics\"\n path: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.path}\"\n \n # Port definition\n # - If the Label exists, only scan the given port.\n # - If it doesn't, use port_filter instead.\n # - If there is no port_filter defined, skip this process\n port: \"{container.label.io.prometheus.port}\"\n port_filter:\n - exclude: [9092,9200,9300]\n - include: 9090-9500\n - include: [9913,9984,24231,42004]\n - exclude:\n container.label.io.prometheus.scrape: \"false\"\n - include:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: true\n conf:\n path: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/path}\"\n port: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/port}\"\n - exclude:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape: false Things to note about this default configuration: Once enabled, this default configuration is ideal for the use case described above in the Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments . All Prometheus scraping is disabled by default to allow for a smooth transition for users of the legacy Prometheus Application Check (see the note below ). To enable the entire config shown here, you would only need to add the following to your dragent.yaml : prometheus:\n enabled: true A Process Filter rule excludes processes that are likely to exist in most environments but are known to never export Prometheus metrics, such as the Docker Proxy and the Agent itself. Another Process Filter rule ensures that any processes configured to be scraped by the legacy Prometheus Application Check will not be scraped. See the section below on the Legacy Prometheus Application Check for details. Another Process Filter rule is tailored to use of container Labels. Processes marked with the container Label io.prometheus.scrape will become eligible for scraping, and if further marked with container Labels io.prometheus.port and\/or io.prometheus.path , scraping will be attempted only on this port and\/or endpoint. If the container is not marked with the specified path Label, scraping the \/metrics endpoint will be attempted. If the container is not marked with the specified port Label, any listening ports in the port_filter will be attempted for scraping (this port_filter in the default is set for the range of ports for common Prometheus exporters , with exclusions for ports in the range that are known to be used by other applications that are not exporters). The final Process Filter include rule is tailored to the use case described above in Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments . With this default configuration enabled, a containerized install of our example exporter shown below would be automatically scraped via the Agent. # docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \\\n --label io.prometheus.scrape=\"true\" \\\n --label io.prometheus.port=\"8080\" \\\n --label io.prometheus.path=\"\/prometheus\" \\\n luca3m\/prometheus-java-app Similarly, in a Kubernetes-based environment, a Deployment with the Annotations as shown in using this example YAML would also be scraped by enabling the default configuration. apiVersion: extensions\/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n name: prometheus-java-app\nspec:\n replicas: 1\n template:\n metadata:\n labels:\n app: prometheus-java-app\n annotations:\n prometheus.io\/scrape: \"true\"\n prometheus.io\/path: \"\/prometheus\"\n prometheus.io\/port: \"8080\"\n spec:\n containers:\n - name: prometheus-java-app\n image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n imagePullPolicy: Always\n\n Finally, we'll consider an example for a non-containerized environment or a containerized environment that doesn't use Labels or Annotations. The following dragent.yaml would override the default and do per-second scrapes of our sample exporter and also a second exporter on port 5005, each at their respective non-standard endpoints. This can be thought of as a conservative \"whitelist\" type of configuration since it restricts scraping to only exporters that are known to exist in the environment and the ports on which they're known to export Prometheus metrics. prometheus:\n enabled: true\n interval: 1\n process_filter:\n - include:\n process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\"\n conf:\n port: 8080\n path: \"\/prometheus\"\n - include:\n port: 5005\n conf:\n port: 5005\n path: \"\/wacko\" Histograms By default, the Agent does not scrape details for the histogram metrics reported by exporters. To enable this, include the additional histograms option: prometheus:\n enabled: true\n histograms: true Note that the way Prometheus histograms are typically reported by exporters, they are cumulative across buckets and also report accumulations within each bucket range since the exporter started. To make this data easier to visualize, the Sysdig Monitor application presents histogram data as a delta over the selected time range. For instance, below we've had our sample Prometheus exporter running for over an hour, accumulating data in a histogram metric called random: # curl http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8080\/prometheus\n...\n# HELP random Random sleep\n# TYPE random histogram\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.005\",} 33.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.01\",} 74.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.025\",} 180.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.05\",} 404.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.075\",} 639.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.1\",} 848.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.25\",} 2145.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.5\",} 4307.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"0.75\",} 6371.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"1.0\",} 8592.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"2.5\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"5.0\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"7.5\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"10.0\",} 8619.0\nrandom_bucket{le=\"+Inf\",} 8619.0\n... However in the Sysdig Monitor interface, if we select the metric and a time range such as 10 minutes, we'll see the per-bucket distribution for only that time range. Hover your mouse over a particular bar to see the bucket range. If this histogram metric is being reported from multiple sources, you will see the contribution to the total from each source based on your choice of Segment by . In this case we are segmenting by hostname and only have one contributing source, called \"ubuntu16\". Logging After the Agent begins scraping Prometheus metrics, there may be a delay of up to a few minutes before the metrics become visible in Sysdig Monitor. To help quickly confirm your configuration is correct, starting with Agent version 0.80.0, the following log line will appear in the Agent log the first time since since starting that it has found and is successfully scraping at least one Prometheus exporter: \n2018-05-04 21:42:10.048, 8820, Information, 05-04 21:42:10.048324 Starting export of Prometheus metrics As this is an INFO level log message, it will appear in Agents using the default logging settings. To reveal even more detail, increase the Agent log level to DEBUG , which produces a message like the following that reveals the name of a specific metric first detected. You can then look for this metric to be visible in Sysdig Monitor shortly after. \n2018-05-04 21:50:46.068, 11212, Debug, 05-04 21:50:46.068141 First prometheus metrics since agent start: pid 9583: 5 metrics including: randomSummary.95percentile Troubleshooting See the previous section for information on expected log messages during successful scraping. If you have enabled Prometheus and are not seeing the Starting export message shown there, revisit your configuration. It is also suggested to leave the configuration option in its default setting of log_errors: true , which will reveal any issues scraping eligible processes in the Agent log. For example, here is an error message for a failed scrape of a TCP port that was listening but not accepting HTTP requests: \n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks[4987] Exception on running check prometheus.5000: Exception('Timeout when hitting http:\/\/localhost:5000\/metrics',)\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, Traceback (most recent call last):\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, File \"\/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/sdchecks.py\", line 246, in run\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, self.check_instance.check(self.instance_conf)\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, File \"\/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/checks.d\/prometheus.py\", line 44, in check\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, metrics = self.get_prometheus_metrics(query_url, timeout, \"prometheus\")\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.076, 4984, Error, sdchecks, File \"\/opt\/draios\/lib\/python\/checks.d\/prometheus.py\", line 105, in get_prometheus_metrics\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.077, 4984, Error, sdchecks, raise Exception(\"Timeout when hitting %s\" % url)\n2017-10-13 22:00:12.077, 4984, Error, sdchecks, Exception: Timeout when hitting http:\/\/localhost:5000\/metrics Here is an example error message for a failed scrape of a port that was responding to HTTP requests on the \/metrics endpoint but not responding with valid Prometheus-format data. The invalid endpoint is responding as follows: # curl http:\/\/localhost:5002\/metrics\nThis ain't no Prometheus metrics! And the corresponding error message in the Agent log, indicating no further scraping will be attempted after the initial failure: \n2017-10-13 22:03:05.081, 5216, Information, sdchecks[5219] Skip retries for Prometheus error: could not convert string to float: ain't\n2017-10-13 22:03:05.082, 5216, Error, sdchecks[5219] Exception on running check prometheus.5002: could not convert string to float: ain't Legacy Prometheus Application Check Special care should be taken if you're already using the legacy Prometheus Application Check (explained below) to scrape any Prometheus metrics. You will be able to scrape for the same metrics using the new approach and they will appear in Sysdig Monitor under the same metric name. However, any historical data from when it was collected via the legacy Prometheus App Check will no longer be visible. As a result, the new approach is disabled by default, and you should carefully plan your transition to using the new approach for each set of metrics when you feel you can endure the break with historical data. The legacy Prometheus application check is able to collect metrics from a static external HTTP endpoint exposing metrics in Prometheus format and import them as StatsD metrics in Sysdig. To configure the legacy Prometheus application check, Add these lines to the agent's configuration file: app_checks:\n - name: prometheus\n pattern:\n comm: python\n arg: \/opt\/draios\/bin\/sdchecks\n conf:\n url: http:\/\/{YOUR_PROMETHEUS_ENDPOINT_IP}:8080\/metrics " },

"body" : "The Sysdig agent retrieves data from your Java virtual machines using the JMX protocol. The agent is configured to automatically discover active Java virtual machines and poll them for basic JVM metrics like Heap Memory and Garbage collector as well as application specific metrics for ActiveMQ, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, HBase, Kafka, Tomcat, and Zookeeper. The agent can also be easily configured to extract custom JMX metrics coming from your own Java processes. Metrics extracted are shown in the pre-defined Application views or under the Metrics > JVM and JMX menus. The default JMX metrics configuration is found in the \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.default.yaml file. When customizing existing entries, copy the complete application's bean listing from that defaults yaml file into the user settings file \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml . The Sysdig agent will merge configurations of both files. Here is what your dragent.yaml file might look like for a customized entry for the Spark application: customerid: 07c948-your-key-here-006f3b\ntags: local:nyc,service:db3\njmx:\n per_process_beans:\n spark: \n pattern: \"spark\"\n beans:\n - query: \"metrics:name=Spark shell.BlockManager.disk.diskSpaceUsed_MB\"\n attributes:\n - name: VALUE \n alias: spark.metric Include the jmx: and per_process_beans: section headers at the beginning of your application\/bean list. For more information on adding parameters to a container agent's configuration file, see Understanding the Agent Config Files . Contents Bean Configuration Limits Aliases Troubleshooting: Why Can't I See Java (JMX) Metrics? JMX Remote Java Versions Java-Based Applications and JMX Authentication Disabling JMX Polling Bean Configuration Basic JVM metrics are pre-defined inside the default_beans: section. This section is defined in the agent's default settings file and contains beans and attributes that are going to be polled for every Java process, like memory and garbage collector usage: jmx:\n default_beans:\n - query: \"java.lang:type=Memory\"\n attributes:\n - HeapMemoryUsage\n - NonHeapMemoryUsage\n - query: \"java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,*\"\n attributes:\n - name: \"CollectionCount\"\n type: \"counter\"\n - name: \"CollectionTime\"\n type: \"counter\" Metrics specific for each application are specified in sections named after the applications. For example, this is the Tomcat section: per_process_beans:\n tomcat:\n pattern: \"catalina\"\n beans:\n - query: \"Catalina:type=Cache,*\"\n attributes:\n - accessCount\n - cacheSize\n - hitsCount\n - . . . The key name, tomcat in this case, will be displayed as a process name in the Sysdig Monitor user interface instead of just java . The pattern: parameter specifies a string that is used to match a java process name and arguments with this set of JMX metrics. If the process main class full name contains the given text, the process is tagged and the metrics specified in the section will be fetched. The class names are matched against the process argument list. If you implement JMX metrics in a custom manner that does not expose the class names on the command line, you will need to find a pattern which conveniently matches your java invocation command line. The beans: section contains the list of beans to be queried, based on JMX patterns. JMX patterns are explained in details in the Oracle documentation , but in practice, the format of the query line is pretty simple: you can specify the full name of the bean like java.lang:type=Memory , or you can fetch multiple beans in a single line using the wildcard * as in: java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,* To get the list of all the beans that your application exports, you can use JVisualVM , Jmxterm , JConsole or other similar tools. Here is a screenshot from JConsole showing where to find the namespace, bean and attribute (metric) information (JConsole is available when you install the Java Development Kit): For each query, you can specify the attributes that you want to retrieve. We support the following JMX attributes (For these attributes, all the subattributes will be retrieved): Numeric CompositeDataSupport Attributes may be absolute values or rates. For values, we need to calculate a per second rate before sending them. In this case, you can specify type: counter , the default is rate which can be omitted, so usually you can simply write the attribute name. Limits The total number of JMX metrics polled per host is limited to 500. The maximum number of beans queried per process is limited to 300. If more metrics are needed please contact your sales representative with your use case. In agents 0.46 and earlier, the limit was 100 beans for each process. Aliases JMX beans and attributes can have very long names. To avoid interface cluttering we added support for aliasing, you can specify an alias in the attribute configuration. For example: cassandra:\n pattern: \"cassandra\"\n beans:\n - query: \"org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageProxy\n attributes:\n - name: RecentWriteLatencyMicros\n alias: cassandra.write.latency\n - name: RecentReadLatencyMicros\n alias: cassandra.read.latency In this way the alias will be used in Sysdig Monitor instead of the raw bean name. Aliases can be dynamic as well, getting data from the bean name - useful where you use pattern bean queries. For example: - query: \"java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,*\"\n attributes:\n - name: CollectionCount\n type: counter\n alias: jvm.gc.NAME.count\n - name: CollectionTime\n type: counter\n alias: jvm.gc.NAME.time This query will match multiple beans (All Garbage collectors) and the metric name will reflect the name of the Garbage Collector. For example: jvm.gc.ConcurrentMarkSweep.count . General syntax is: {<bean_property_key>} , to get all beans properties you can use a JMX explorer like JVisualVM or Jmxterm. Troubleshooting: Why Can't I See Java (JMX) Metrics? The Sysdig agent normally auto-discovers Java processes running on your host and enables the JMX extensions for polling them. JMX Remote If your Java application is not discovered automatically by the agent, try adding the following parameter on your application's command line: -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote For more information, see Oracle's web page on monitoring using JMX technology . Java Versions Only Java versions 7 and 8 are currently supported by the Sysdig agent. If you do not see JMX metrics reporting, your Java version may be older or newer. Java-Based Applications and JMX Authentication For Java-based applications (Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Tomcat, Zookeeper and etc.), the Sysdig agent requires the Java runtime environment (JRE) to be installed to poll for metrics (beans). The Sysdig agent does not support JMX authentication. If the Docker-container-based Sysdig agent is installed, the JRE is installed alongside the agent binaries and no further dependencies exist. However, if you are installing the service-based agent (non-container) and you do not see the JVM\/JMX metrics reporting, your host may not have the JRE installed or it may not be installed in the expected location: usr\/bin\/java To confirm if the Sysdig agent is able to find the JRE, restart the agent with service dragent restart and check the agent's \/opt\/draios\/logs\/draios.log file for the two Java detection and location log entries recorded during agent startup. Example if Java is missing or not found: \n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java detected: false\n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java_binary: Example if Java is found: \n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java detected: true\n2017-09-08 23:19:27.944, Information, java_binary: \/usr\/bin\/java If Java is not installed, the resolution is to install the Java Runtime Environment . If your host has Java installed but not in the expected location ( \/usr\/bin\/java ) you can install a symlink from \/usr\/bin\/java to the actual binary OR set the java_home: variable in the Sysdig agent's configuration file: \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml java_home: \/usr\/my_java_location\/ Disabling JMX Polling If you do not need it or otherwise want to disable JMX metrics reporting, you can add the following two lines to the agent's user settings configuration file \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml : jmx:\n enabled: false After editing the file, restart the native Linux agent via service dragent restart or restart the container agent to make the change take effect. If using our containerized agent, instead of editing the dragent.yaml file, you can add this extra parameter in the docker run command when starting the agent: \n-e ADDITIONAL_CONF=\"jmx:\\n enabled: false\\n\" " },

The Sysdig agent contains an embedded StatsD server, so your custom metrics can now be sent to our collector and be relayed to the Sysdig Monitor backend for aggregation. Your application metrics and the rich set of metrics collected by our agent already can all be visualized in the same simple and intuitive graphical interface. Configuring alert notifications is also exactly the same. Contents Installation and Configuration Sending StatsD Metrics Active Collection Passive Collection Supported Metric Types Counter Gauge Set Metric Labels Limits Compatible Clients Turning Off StatsD Reporting Changing the StatsD Listener Port and Transport Protocol Characters Allowed For StatsD Metric Names Installation and Configuration The Statsd server, embedded in Sysdig agent beginning with version 0.1.136, is pre-configured and starts by default so no additional user configuration is necessary. Install the agent in a supported distribution directly or install the Docker containerized version in your container server and you're done. Sending StatsD Metrics Active Collection By default, the Sysdig agent's embedded StatsD collector listens on the standard StatsD port, 8125 , both on TCP and UDP. StatsD is a text based protocol , where samples are separated by a \\n . Sending metrics from your application to the collector is as simple as: \necho \"hello_statsd:1|c\" > \/dev\/udp\/127.0.0.1\/8125 The example transmits the counter metric \"hello_statsd\" with a value of '1' to the Statsd collector listening on UDP port 8125. Here is a second example sending the output of a more complex shell command giving the number of established network connections: \necho \"EstablishedConnections:`netstat -a | grep ESTAB | wc -l`|c\" > \/dev\/udp\/127.0.0.1\/8125 The protocol format is as follows: \nMETRIC_NAME:METRIC_VALUE|TYPE[|@SAMPLING_RATIO] Metric names can be any string except reserved characters: |#:@ . Value is a number and depends on the metric type. Type can be any of: c , ms , g , s . Sampling ratio is a value between 0 (exclusive) and 1 and it's used to handle subsampling. When sent, metrics will be available in the same display menu for the subviews as the built in metrics. Passive Collection In infrastructures already containing a third party StatsD collection server, StatsD metrics can be collected \"out of band\". A passive collection technique is automatically performed by our agent by intercepting system calls - as is done for all the Sysdig Monitor metrics normally collected. This method does not require changing your current StatsD configuration and is an excellent way to 'test drive' the Sysdig Monitor application without having to perform any modifications other than agent installation. The passive mode of collection is especially suitable for containerized environments where simplicity and efficiency are essential. With the containerized version of the Sysdig Monitor agent running on the host, all other container applications can continue to transmit to any currently implemented collector. In the case where no collector exists, container applications can simply be configured to send StatsD metrics to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1) as demonstrated above - no actual StatsD server needs to be listening at that address. Effectively, each network transmission made from inside the application container, including statsd messages sent to a non existent destination, generates a system call. The Sysdig agent captures these system calls from its own container, where the statsd collector is listening. In practice, the Sysdig agent acts as a transparent proxy between the application and the StatsD collector, even if they are in different containers. The agent correlates which container a system call is coming from, and uses that information to transparently label the StatsD messages. The above graphic demonstrates the components of the Sysdig agent and where metrics are actively or passively collected. Regardless of the method of collection, the number of StatsD metrics the agent can transmit is limited by your payment plan. Note 1 : When using the passive technique, ICMP port unreachable events may be generated on the host network. Note 2: Some clients may use IPv6 addressing (::1) for the \"localhost\" address string. Metrics collection over IPv6 is not supported at this time. If your StatsD metrics are not visible in the Sysdig Monitor interface, please use \"127.0.0.1\" instead of \"localhost\" string to force IPv4. Another solution that may be required is adding the JVM option: java.net .preferIPv4Stack=true. Note 3 : When StatsD metrics are not continuously transmitted by your application (once per second as in the case of all agent created metrics), the charts will render a 'zero' or null value. Any alert conditions will only look at those Statsd values actually transmitted and ignore the nulls. For more detail on the benefits of Sysdig Monitor's implementation of StatsD, please see the article State of the Art: StatsD Deployment Strategies in Containerized Environments . Supported Metric Types Counter A counter metric is updated with the value sent by the application, sent to the Sysdig Monitor backend, and then reset to zero. You can use it to count, for example, how many calls have been made to an API: api.login:1|c You can specify negative values to decrement a counter. Gauge A gauge is a single value that will be sent as is: table_size:10000|g These are plotted as received, in the sense, they are at a point in time metrics. You can achieve relative increments or decrements on a counter by prepending the value with a + or a - respectively. As an example, these three samples will cause table_size to be 950: table_size:1000|g\ntable_size:-100|g\ntable_size:+50|g In Sysdig Monitor, the gauge value is only rendered on the various charts when it is actually transmitted by your application. When not transmitted, a null is plotted on the charts which is not used in any calculations or alerts. Set A set is like a counter, but it counts unique elements. For example: \nactive_users:user1|s active_users:user2|sactive_users:user1|s Will cause the value of active_users to be 2. Metric Labels Labels are an extension of the StatsD specification offered by Sysdig Monitor to offer better flexibility in the way metrics are grouped, filtered and visualized. Labeling can be achieved by using the following syntax: enqueued_messages#users,country=italy:10|c In general, this is the syntax you can use for labeling: \nMETRIC_NAME#LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE,LABEL_NAME ... Labels can be simple strings or key\/value pairs, separated by an = sign. Simple labels can be used for filtering in the Sysdig Monitor web interface. Key\/value labels can be used for both filtering and segmentation. Label names prefixed with 'agent.label' are reserved for Sysdig agent use only and any custom labels starting with that prefix will be ignored. Limits The number of StatsD metrics the agent can transmit is limited to 100 for the host and 100 for all running containers combined. If more metrics are needed please contact your sales representative with your use case. Compatible Clients Every StatsD compliant client works with our implementation. Here is a quick list, it's provided just as reference. We don't support them, we support only the protocol specification compliance. Node.js Java Python PHP Ruby Go A full list can be found at the StatsD GitHub page . Turning Off StatsD Reporting To disable Sysdig agent's embedded StatsD server, append the following lines to the \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml configuration file in each installed host: statsd:\n enabled: false After modifying the configuration file, you will need to restart the agent with: service dragent restart Changing the StatsD Listener Port and Transport Protocol To modify the port that the agent's embedded StatsD server listens on, append the following lines to the \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml configuration file in each installed host (replace #### with your port): statsd:\n tcp_port: ####\n udp_port: #### Characters Allowed For StatsD Metric Names Use standard ASCII characters, we suggest also to use . namespaces as we do for all our metrics. Allowed characters: a-z A-Z 0-9 _ . For more information on adding parameters to a container agent's configuration file, see the FAQ: How Can I Edit the Agents Configuration File . " },

Caveats Implementation Preparation Edit dragent.yaml Parameters View Log File Metrics in the Monitor UI Caveats The logwatcher chisel adds to Sysdig's monitoring capability but is not a fully featured log monitor. Note the following limitations: No regex support: Sysdig does not offer regex support; you must define the precise log file and string to be searched. (If you were to supply a string with spaces, forward-slashes, or back-slashes in it, the metric generated would also have these characters and so could not be used to create an alert.) Limit of 12 string searches\/host: Logwatcher is implemented as a LUA script and, due to resources consumed by this chisel, it is not recommended to have more than a dozen string searches configured per agent\/host. Implementation Edit the agent configuration file to enable the logwatcher chisel. See Understanding the Agent Config Files for editing options. Preparation Determine the log file name(s) and string(s) you want to monitor. To monitor the output of docker logs <container-name>, find the container's docker log file with: docker inspect <container-name> | grep LogPath Edit dragent.yaml Access dragent.yaml directly at \/opt\/draios\/etc\/dragent.yaml .
