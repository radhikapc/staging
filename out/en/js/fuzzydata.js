"body" : "Because custom metrics and their labels can grow to millions of entries, they are indexed by the system, and a \"metrics lifecycle\" is imposed both on them and their labels. This improves performance and prevents cluttering the system with a short-lived container or metric names. Sysdig Monitor maintains an index of all the custom metrics and the custom labels that have reported data in the last 14 days. Each indexed metric\/label is available when configuring new or existing artifacts, i.e. dashboards, scopes, alerts, and so on. When the system does not receive any data for a metric\/label for more than 14 days, or a metric\/label is found that has never reported data (for example, it was never added to the metric index), it is removed from the index if present, and marked as missing . Missing metrics are different from instances where a panel\/dashboard states that \" Metric data is not available \". A missing metric\/label is still available for data queries and charts. Existing artifacts are not affected. However, it is not possible to configure new artifacts with a missing metric\/label, or to update existing artifacts unless the missing metrics\/labels are removed from the configuration. If new data is received for a missing metric\/label, we put it back into the index and the above limitations are removed. What You See in the UI : If you configured a dashboard three months ago and a metric in it is now missing, when you go to the dashboard and update it in the dashboard settings, a warning appears below the metric stating that the metric is missing. To be able to update the dashboard, you must remove all missing metrics from it.

"body" : "Time aggregation comes into effect in two overlapping situations: Charts can only render a limited number of data points. To look at a wide range of data, Sysdig Monitor may need to aggregate granular data into larger samples for visualization. Sysdig Monitor rolls up historical data over time. Sysdig retains rollups based on each aggregation type, to allow users to choose which datapoints to utilize when evaluating older data. By default, Sysdig agents collect and report metrics at a 10 second resolution. For time series charts covering five minutes or less, datapoints are drawn at this 10 second resolution, and any time aggregation selections will have no effect. When an amount of time greater than five minutes is displayed, data points are drawn as an aggregate for an appropriate time interval. For example, for a chart covering one hour, each datapoint would reflect a one minute interval. At time intervals of one minute and above, charts can be configured to display different aggregates for the 10 second metrics used to calculate each datapoint. Aggregation Type Description average The average of the retrieved metric values across the time period. rate The average value of the metric across the time period evaluated. maximum The highest value during the time period evaluated. minimum The lowest value during the time period evaluated. sum The combined sum of the metric across the time period evaluated. In the example images below, the kubernetes.deployment.replicas.available metrics first uses the average for time aggregation: Then uses the sum for time aggregation: Rate and average are very similar and often provide the same result. However, the calculation of each is different. If time aggregation is set to one minute, the agent is supposed to retrieve six samples (one every 10 seconds). In some cases, samples may not be there, due to disconnections or other circumstances. For this example, four samples are available. If this was the case, the average would be calculated by dividing by four, while the rate would be calculated by dividing by six. Most metrics are sampled once for each time interval, resulting in average and rate returning the same value. However, there will be a distinction for any metrics not reported at every time interval. For example, some custom statsd metrics. Rate is currently referred to as timeAvg in the Sysdig Monitor API and advanced alerting language. By default, average is used when displaying data points for a time interval. " },

"body" : "Topology View provides an interactive, animated interface to visualize how different components in your system interact with each other in real time. The interface by default renders a selected host's top processes and their interaction with processes on remote hosts or host groups. Entities in any valid logical grouping can be visually represented with Topology View. The interaction is depicted as nodes and links. Links connect nodes. Nodes and links radially expand from the left. Nodes : The entities participating in network communication. A node could be a process, a container, a host, or any label identified by Sysdig Agent. For example: kubernetes.pod.name. Links : The network connection between nodes. Hosts and their child processes ( host.hostName > proc.name) serve as the default grouping for the Topology View. Scaling a Topology View is limited by the number of processes and connections. Sysdig Monitor creates the Topology View by identifying network endpoints (IP addresses) derived from system call data. Topology View in the Explore tab provides pre-defined dashboards to represent CPU Usage , Network Traffic , and Response Time metrics, and as such, they are not configurable. It serves as a template diagnostic tool that provides bottom-up inter-process connection metrics as graphs. For a detailed description on each default metric type supported by the Topology View, see Topology Dashboards . " },

"body" : "The UI allows you to zoom in, zoom out, fit, pan, and reset the display, and expand and collapse the nodes. Zoom into an entity by clicking the associated + icon and view the top processes within the selected entity. You can expand the hosts to see individual processes running inside and corresponding metric value. The links indicating network connections are rendered between entities in the selected hierarchy and, when zoomed, between processes and entities. Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom the content, then left-click and drag to move the map components within the window. Topology View uses legends and color schemes. This section explains what they mean. The line width (thickness) of the links expresses metric values relative to other connections in the system. Scaling line width is relative to the metric values associated with each link. Topology View dynamically adjusts the legend as the data recorded for each connection changes. The thin black line(—): Lower metric values. The thick black line( — ): Higher metric values. Dashed lines(---): A previously existed connection. For example, an active connection between node A and B, rendered as a solid line, could dissolve after a data update if that connection does not exist anymore in the new data set. Instead of removing it from the graph, Sysdig Monitor depicts the inactive connection as a dotted line until the next data update. If the connection returns in a subsequent data update, it is rendered again as a solid line. If the connection does not exist, the line will be removed. The color scheme is determined by color coding for the customizable threshold. The nodes are identified by five colors: Green indicates the node is healthy. Yellow indicates the node is in a warning state. Red indicates the node is in a critical state. Grey indicates the node state is unknown. An unknown node typically signifies a node where no Sysdig Agent installed. Light Blue indicates no threshold is defined for the metrics. " },

Top Ports The top ports dashboard displays statistics broken down by the port, including the number of connections to each port, and the incoming, outgoing, and total bytes. " },

"body" : "The Kubernetes * Health dashboards break down resource and performance metrics by various logical entities to allow for an in-depth analysis, and for critical issues to be identified and isolated. Each dashboard is built around the Golden Signals approach to monitoring: Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation. Resource utilization metrics are oriented toward health and performance. These are aspects like CPU, memory, network, and storage usage by Kubernetes object. kube-state-metrics is about the status or count. Pairing kube-state-metrics with resource utilization metrics, each dashboard provides a comprehensive picture of what’s happening in your Kubernetes environment. Dashboard Description Use Cases Kubernetes Deployment Health Highlights whether each deployment has a sufficient number of available pods and resources, and indicates the number of pods running, desired, or have been updated. Identify performance bottlenecks. Locate logical entities that are consuming too many cluster resources, or that are rapidly trending upwards towards unsustainable levels. Dive deeper into specific entities to identify the root cause of problems. Use usage percentages over time to better estimate expansion capacity. For example: A deployment with no available pods indicates that the corresponding app is not serving requests. Getting a dashboard on this condition means you can visualize the metrics and spring into action to find and resolve the issue quickly. Dropping the number of pods available and remaining below the desired number indicate that your application performance is degraded or not running at the redundancy required. With these metrics represented on the dashboard, you get a quick glance of the severity of the impact on your app's user experience. A lower number of replicas running during an extended period of time than the number of replicas desired indicates a symptom of entities not working properly, such as nodes or resources unavailability, Kubernetes or Docker Engine failure, broken Docker images, and so on. No replicas for a deployment object could potentially mean that the app is down. A continuous loop of pod restart (CrashLoopBackOff) might be associated with missing dependencies or unmet requirements, or insufficient resources. In CrashLoopBackOff, pods never get into ready status and therefore are counted as unavailable and down. Kubernetes Namespace Health Displays metrics such as resource requests and resource limits at the namespace level; identifies the performance of the Kubernetes entities such as pods, deployments, DaemonSet, Statefulset, and jobs, and compliance with replicaSets specs. Highlights the number of services, deployments, replicaSets, and jobs per namespace. Kubernetes Nodes Health Highlights the number of nodes that are ready, unavailable, or out of disk; the number of nodes that are under the memory, disk, or network pressure; compares allocatable capacity with requested capacity on the node; provides the number of pod resources of a node that are available for scheduling and the available capacity to serve the pods running on the nodes. Kubernetes Pod Health Helps identify potential bottlenecks by graphing the number of container restarts, the number of pods waiting to be scheduled, resource utilization of containers within each pod and available capacity to serve pod requests, the number of available pods compared to the desired pods, and the number of pods in available state and ready to serve requests. Kubernetes replicaSet Health Provides details such as the number of pods per replicaSet, the desired number of pods per replicaSet, and pods per replicaSet that are in a ready state. Kubernetes Service Health Displays resource utilization of your services, container distribution, response time, and request count; provides details such as pod restarts and error count indicating potential performance issues. Kubernetes Health Overview Provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of the entire Kubernetes environment, broken down by various logical entities and underlying resource availability and usage. This dashboard breaks down resource and performance kube-state-metrics by the logical Kubernetes entities, such as pods, namespaces, deployments, and replicaSets, containers, and so on. Use these three dashboards to provide a high-level overview of all aspects of the Kubernetes environment's performance and resource saturation status. Set high-level alerts to narrow down areas of concern, before moving to the more in-depth dashboards. Quickly identify major performance issues within each type of entity. Kubernetes Cluster and Node Capacity Highlights a comprehensive overview of the performance of the hosts or nodes that form the Kubernetes cluster, including CPU, memory, and file system usage, and network traffic. Before analyzing the Dashboard, consider the following guidelines related to resource usage: If Resource Limits is undefined for a container, Kubernetes does not default to a value. if Resource Requests is unspecified for a container, Kubernetes defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Limits do not default to any value. If both Resource Limits and Resource Requests are not specified, no matter which value had been defaulted by Kubernetes, kube-state-metric (and hence Sysdig Monitor) reports zero. Therefore, only user-defined requested are reported by the kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte metric . The memory used by a container (the value returned by memory.used.bytes) can be greater than the memory requested by a pod (the value returned by kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte) . This is permissible in Kubernetes because Requests value determines the minimum amount of resources required. For these reasons, it can be deduced that In some cases, the value of Used Resources will be more than that of Resource Requests and Resource Limits, and the value of Resource RequestS could be more than that of Resource Limit. The value of kubernetes.pod.resourceRequests.memByte <= memory.used.bytes <= kubernetes.pod.resourceLimits.memByte " },

"body" : "Steps Description Decide What to monitor Determine what type of problem you want to be alerted on. See Alert Types to choose a type of problem. Define how it will be monitored Specify exactly what behavior triggers a violation. For example, Marathon App is down on the Kubernetes Cluster named Production for ten minutes. Decide Where to monitor Narrow down your environment to receive fine-tuned results. Use Scope to choose an entity that you want to keep a close watch on. Specify additional segments (entities) to give context to the problem. For example, in addition to specifying a Kubernetes cluster, add a namespace and deployment to refine your scope. Define when to notify Define the threshold and time window for assessing the alert condition. Single Alert fires an alert for your entire scope, while Multiple Alert fires if any or every segment breach the threshold at once. Multiple Alerts include all the segments you specified to uniquely identify the location and thus provides full qualification of where the problem occurred. The higher the number of segments the easier to uniquely identify the affected entities. A good analogy for multiple alerts is alerting on cities. For example, creating multiple alerts on San Francisco would trigger an alert which will include information such as the country that it is part of is the USA and the continent is North America. Trigger gives you control over how notifications are created. For example, you may want to receive a notification for every violation, or want only a single notification for a series of consecutive violations. Decide how notifications are sent Alert supports customizable notification channels, including email, mobile push notifications, OpsGenie, Slack, and more. To see supported services, see Notification channels . To create alerts, simply: Choose an Alert Type . Configure alert parameters . Configure the notification channels you want to use for alert notification. Sysdig sometimes deprecates outdated metrics. Alerts that use these metrics will not be modified or disabled, but will no longer be updated. See Heuristic and Deprecated Metrics . " },

This section covers general instructions to help you acquainted with and navigate the Alerts user interface. To configure an alert, Open the Alert Wizard and set the following parameters: (Setup): Type: Select the desired Alert Type . Each type has different parameters, but they follow the same pattern: Name: Specify a meaningful name that can uniquely represent the Alert that you are creating. For example, the entity that alert targets, such as Production Cluster Failed Scheduling pods . Description (optional): Briefly expand on the alert name or alert condition to give additional context for the recipient. Priority: High, Medium, Low, and Info are reflected in the Events list, where you can sort by the severity of the Event\/Alert. Parameters in Define , Notify , and Act sections (1) Define: Metric : Select a metric or entity that this alert will monitor. You also define how the data is aggregated, such as avg, max, min or sum. Metrics are applied to a group of items (group aggregation). To alert on multiple metrics using boolean logic, click Create multi-condition alerts . See Multi-Condition Alerts . Scope : Everywhere, or a more limited scope to filter a specific component of the infrastructure monitored, such as a Kubernetes deployment, a Sysdig Agent, or a specific service. Trigger : Boundaries for assessing the alert condition, and whether to send a single alert or multiple alerts. Supported time scales are minute , hour , or day . Single alert: Single Alert fires an alert for your entire scope. Multiple alerts: Multiple Alert fires if any or every segment breaches the threshold at once. Multiple alerts are triggered for each segment you specify. The specified segments will be represented in alerts. The higher the number of segments the easier to uniquely identify the affected entities. For detailed description, see respective sections on Alert Types. (2) Notify Notification Channel: Select from the configured notification channels in the list. Supported channels are: Email Slack Amazon SNS Topic Opsgenie Pagerduty VictorOps Webhook Notification Options: Set the time interval at which multiple alerts should be sent. Format Message: I f applicable, add message format details. See Customize Notifications. (3) Act (Optional): Configure a Sysdig capture. See also Captures .

All the notification channels support this added contextual information and customization flexibility. Modify the subject, body, or both of the alert notification with the following: Plaintext: A custom message stating the problem. For example, Stalled Deployment. Hyperlink: For example, URL to a Dashboard. Dynamic Variable: For example, a hostname. Note the conventions: All variables that you insert must be enclosed in double curly braces, such as {{file_mount}} . Variables are case sensitive. The variables should correspond to the segment values you created the alert for. For example, if an alert is segmented by host.hostName and container.name , the corresponding variables will be {{host.hostName}} and {{container.name}} respectively, and no other segment variables are allowed in the notification subject and body. Notification subjects will not show up on the Event feed. Using a variable that is not a part of the segment will trigger an error. The segment variables used in an alert are turned to the current system values upon sending the alert. The body of the notification message contains a Default Alert Template.

Lists are (surprise!) lists of items that can be included in rules, macros, or other lists. Unlike rules\/macros, they can not be parsed as Sysdig filtering expressions. Behind the scenes, the falco_rules.yaml file contains the raw code for all the Falco rules in the environment, including Falco macros and lists. " },

"body" : "For policy events local to the environment, the first step to address them is by adding custom Falco rules via the Rules Editor tab of the Policies module. These additions will extend or overwrite the behavior of a list, macro, or rule from the default rules section, in order to address the false positive. A number of rules have a macro with the prefix user_, that can be overridden in the custom rules section in order to change the behavior of a rule. Some examples include: user_known_write_etc_conditions user_read_sensitive_file_conditions user_known_change_thread_namespace_binaries user_shell_container_exclusions user_trusted_containers user_sensitive_mount_containers If a user_ macro is not available, Sysdig recommends appending changes to an existing list, macro, or rule, instead of overwriting them. Overwritten lists, macros, and rules will remain static when the default rules are updated. This could lead to new default rules being shadowed and inaccessible to the user. The specific changes necessary to the Falco rules depend heavily on the policy that triggered the false positives. A few examples are shown below: Write below etc For the Write Below etc policy, there may be an additional program that writes specific file(s) below \/etc (this example uses the program catsd , and the file \/etc\/catfood.cfg ). A macro could then be defined as follows: - macro: catsd_writing_catfood_cfg\n condition: (proc.name=catsd and fd.name=\/etc\/catfood.cfg) In addition, the macro user_known_write_etc_conditions would need to be overwritten to add a new exception: - macro: user_known_write_etc_conditions\n condition: catsd_writing_catfood_cfg Launch Privileged Container For the Launch Privileged Container policy, there may be a specific container that must run with privileges. The example macro below uses images starting with registry.customer.com\/mydatastore , and overrides the user_trusted_containers macro: - macro: user_trusted_containers\n condition: (container.image startswith registry.customer.com\/mydatastore) Run shelluntrusted For the Run shelluntrusted policy, a program may be present that spawns shells in the environment for legitimate purposes. The example below appends php to the list of known shell spawn binaries, using the user_known_shell_spawn_binaries list: - list: user_known_shell_spawn_binaries\n append: true\n items: [php] For more information on creating Falco rules, refer to the Falco Rules documentation.

TCP : Use TCP for security incidents as it's far more reliable than UDP in terms of handling network congestion and preventing packet loss. Use port 514 for TCP connections as well. TCP with the port 514 is used to increase data transfer reliability. The default port is 6514 for RFC 5425 specifications.

Select the registry Type from the drop-down menu. Configure the registry-specific credentials (based on the Type chosen): Docker V2 There are many Docker V2 registries, and the credential requirements may differ. For example, for Azure Container Registry: Admin Account Username : in the 'az acr credentials show --name <registry name>' command result Password : The password or password2 value from the 'az acr credentials show' command result Service Principal Username : The service principal app id Password : The service principal password AWS ECR: AWS access key AWS secret key Google Container Registry: JSON Key (Primarily for OpenShift clusters): Add an internal registry address . The recommended way to run an image registry for an OpenShift cluster is to run it locally. The Sysdig agent will detect the internal registry names, but for the Anchore engine to pull and scan the image it needs access to the internal registry itself. Example: External name: mytestregistry.example.com Internal name: docker-registry.default.svc:5000 Sysdig maps the internal registry name to the external registry name, so the Runtime and Repository lists will show only the external names. Optional: Toggle the switch to Allow Self-Signed certificates. By default, the UI will only pull images from a TLS\/SSL-enabled registry. Toggle Allow Self-Signed to instruct the UI not to validate the certificate (if the registry is protected with a self-signed certificate or a cert from an unknown certificate authority). Optional: Toggle the Test Credentials switch to validate your entries. When enabled, Sysdig will attempt to pull the image using the entered credentials. If it succeeds, the registry will be saved. If it fails, you will receive an error and can correct the credentials or image details. If enabled, then enter the test registry path in the format : registry\/repo:tag E.g. quay.io\/sysdig\/agent:0.89 Click Save . " },

For example, imagine a list with two defined policy assignments: Priority 1 Registry = quay.io Repository = sysdig\/* Priority 2 Registry = quay.io Repository = sysdig\/myrepo Since the first rule uses a wild card, the evaluation applies to all repos beginning with sysdig\/ and will stop before evaluating sysdig\/myrepo .

It has the format : \nregistry = * repository = * tag = * assigned policy = default (You can change the assigned policy , but other fields cannot be edited.)

In Sysdig Secure, full benchmarks are always run, but you can filter your view of the report to see only top-priority (Level 1 Profile) or only the secondary (Level 2 Priority) results.

The intent of the Level 1 profile benchmark is to lower the attack surface of your organization while keeping machines usable and not hindering business functionality. Level 2 Profile: Extensive checks, more complete Considered to be \"defense in depth\" and is intended for environments where security is paramount. The recommendations associated with the Level 2 profile can have an adverse effect on your organization if not implemented appropriately or without due care.

It is the most dynamic component of the system, and requires additional attention to ensure that your system is performing well and highly responsive. This component is stateful, and should be treated more carefully than stateless components. Cassandra sizing is based on a minimum replication factor as well as the number of agents writing data. A minimum replication factor of 3 is recommended for the Sysdig application, which allows the cluster to survive the failure of 1 Cassandra instance. Each agent consumes anywhere from 500MB to 2GB of Cassandra storage, with average sizing at 1.5GB\/agent. Because of Sysdig's data aggregation model, this storage should comfortably handle multi-year history. This needs to then be multiplied by the replication factor to determine the total disk space required. A rough calculation might be: 100 agents = 150GB raw, X replication factor of 3, = 450GB total To be safe we recommend that you size some additional disk space as buffer (say 25-50%) on top of that.

This guide describes how to install the Replicated client and use it to install and manage the Sysdig platform.

Airgapped or non-airgapped environment: If your environment is accessible to the Internet during the install process, then the installation options include both script-based or GUI-based. In airgapped environments (no Internet access), you must download components into your airgapped repository, and can only use the GUI-based installation. See Airgapped Installation . Where to put the Replicated Management Console: When installing on-premises using Replicated as the orchestrator, the following Replicated components will be installed on your system: Replicated UI (on a host you designate to host the Replicated Management Console) Replicated retraced containers that handle logging (on the Management Console host only) Replicated operator component (will go on all hosts) In a multi-host installation, one server will be the Replicated Management Console host.

IP packet forwarding is governed by the ip_forward system parameter. Packets can only pass between containers if this parameter is 1 . Usually, you will simply leave the Docker server at its default setting --ip-forward=true and Docker will go set ip_forward to 1 for you when the server starts up. If you set --ip-forward=false and your system’s kernel has it enabled, the --ip-forward=false option has no effect. To check the setting on your kernel use: sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding To turn it on use: sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1 Please see this article from docker for more details on Docker Connectivity.

"body" : "The Sysdig platform ordinarily maintains its own user database to hold a username and password hash, as well as settings for Admin privileges, Sysdig team membership, and a user’s configured dashboards and alerts. Sysdig's LDAP authentication feature provides a means to allow the Sysdig platform to query your separate directory server to validate username\/password. Upon successful authentication, a corresponding user record in the Sysdig platform’s user database is automatically created. When the LDAP feature is in use, the user’s directory password is not stored in the Sysdig user database. Once LDAP authentication is enabled, all normal user authentication will be performed against your configured directory server. Other local, non-LDAP users that were created before LDAP was enabled can still authenticate via LDAP as long as their username in your directory matches with the username of their pre-existing record in the Sysdig user database. For example, consider a user jdoe@example.com who had been a user in the Sysdig environment before LDAP was enabled. Once LDAP authentication is enabled, if a user jdoe exists in the directory server and is able to authenticate successfully via LDAP, they will be permitted to log in to the Sysdig platform as the pre-existing jdoe@example.com user. Any user-specific configuration (Alerts, Dashboards, etc.) that were attached to jdoe@example.com will still be visible to this user. Any password previously set for such a pre-existing user record will not be used for authentication to the Sysdig platform unless LDAP authentication is disabled. LDAP can be complex to configure. Sysdig strongly recommends that you first refine your LDAP configuration in a separate test setup before applying the LDAP settings in your production environment. " },

"body" : "Data about your users that need to access the Sysdig platform may be stored across many directory servers in your environment. As the Sysdig platform is only able to query one LDAP server endpoint, you would need to take extra steps to ensure successful authentication for such users. The simplest approach to achieve this is to query against a Global Catalog . As the Global Catalog stores a copy of all Active Directory objects in a forest, this provides a fast and convenient target for the Sysdig platform to find all users that may need to authenticate. Since queries against the Global Catalog are also performed via LDAP, you simply need to ensure your LDAP configuration specifies the appropriate address and TCP port for the Global Catalog, e.g. ldap:\/\/176.16.0.1:3268 for cleartext LDAP or ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:3269 for LDAP over SSL. If querying against a Global Catalog, the referral option of the Sysdig platform's LDAP configuration can remain at its default setting of \"IGNORE\" . If a Global Catalog is not available, another approach is to leverage referral chasing . Such chasing depends on complex interplay of configuration settings, DNS resolution, and network connectivity to multiple servers. If you require this option, carefully read the tips in this section and validate your configuration in a test environment before attempting its use in production. Contact Sysdig support for assistance as necessary. For our example configuration, we've added another Domain Controller to our environment that holds users a separate set of users for the child domain eu.example.local . We'd like to permit login for a user \" eurodude \" in the child domain. This user has distinguishedName : \nCN=Euro Dude,CN=Users,DC=eu,DC=example,DC=local In the example configuration settings_login_referral_follow.json shown below, the Sysdig platform still begins its LDAP queries at the same top-level server target. However, the referral option is set to \"FOLLOW\" , which will cause the Sysdig platform to perform subsequent queries if a query returns one or more referrals. {\n \"authenticationSettings\": {\n \"settings\": {\n \"loginConnectionSettings\": {\n \"server\": \"ldap:\/\/172.16.0.1\",\n \"managerDn\": \"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"managerPassword\": \"myMgrPassword\",\n \"referral\": \"FOLLOW\"\n },\n \"loginFilter\": {\n \"searchBase\": \"dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"searchFilter\": \"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\"\n }\n },\n \"version\": 1,\n \"type\": \"ldap\"\n }\n} Note also how in this case the rootDn option is left unspecified and the searchBase is set to the distinguished name of the top-level domain. This is necessary to ensure the scope of the chased referral queries will include the child domain. If rootDn and searchBase had been left as they were set in the settings_login_simple.json example, the initial query would have been targeted only within cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local and hence the referral would never have been returned by the top-level server. Note these other caveats of referral chasing in the Sysdig platform: Referrals may only be successfully chased to child domains. If referrals point to parallel domains (e.g. for our example, dc=adjacent,dc=local ) the queries will not succeed and users stored in the directory servers for such domains will not be able to authenticate. The LDAP library used by the Sysdig platform does not log information about each referral it attempts to chase. Therefore, if you enable referral chasing, it is important that you understand the server targets that may be chased in your environment and ensure the network connectivity (routing\/firewalls) will permit the Sysdig platform to query these server targets. If LDAP queries are failing due to a network connectivity issue, this will typically be accompanied by delays during Sysdig user logins of approximately 30 seconds followed by a login failure with an HTTP 504 error message shown in the login screen. If this occurs, contact Sysdig support for assistance. " },

"body" : "The default behavior of the LDAP feature is to create a new record in the Sysdig user database when a user authenticates successfully via LDAP for the first time. However, it may be desirable to add such user records in advance of their first login, such as if you wish to use automation to change user permissions, assign team membership, or pre-populate Dashboard\/Alert configurations. A create_user.sh helper script is available in the sysdig-cloud-scripts repository to create such user records via the API. This script can also be used to enable\/disable this functionality in the Sysdig platform. See the README for details. Additional details regarding this type of user creation in conjunction with LDAP authentication: This method allows creation of any username, even if it doesn't currently exist in the directory that is queried via LDAP. When LDAP authentication is enabled, such users can be created with a simple username (e.g. jdoe ) or with an email-style postfix (as is typical for non-LDAP Sysdig user, e.g. jdoe@example.com ). In this latter case only the username portion ( jdoe ) is used when the Sysdig platform is performing an LDAP query during attempted login. While the password must be included in the config you POST to create the user, it is not used by the Sysdig platform when LDAP is enabled, as authentication will always be performed via LDAP. For this same reason, if a user has been created in this way, they will not be able to login unless there is a matching user in the directory that is queried via LDAP. The firstName and lastName values as specified in the example are optional and independent from any equivalent name settings in the directory that is queried via LDAP. " },

"body" : "LDAP support has been tested with Active Directory in Windows Server 2012 R2. It may work with AD versions that ship with other versions of Windows, or other directory servers that use the LDAP protocol. If you are intending to use LDAP with something other than Active Directory, please contact Sysdig Support. The LDAP feature is only present in Sysdig software platform installs (not the SaaS version). Only one LDAP config can exist per deployment (i.e. the platform can only query one directory server endpoint). Because the Sysdig software platform is based on the same technology as the SaaS-based Sysdig service, it theoretically supports the configuration of multiple “customers” using the same install. However, the multi-customer option is not supported when the LDAP feature is enabled. When LDAP authentication is enabled, adding users via email \"invites\" is not possible. LDAP authentication for directory usernames that begin or end with a space character (e.g. \" jdoe\" or \"jdoe \" ) are not supported. Configuration entries that contain special characters (for instance, a managerPassword that contains a backslash character) are supported, but note that you will need to perform proper JSON escaping in the configuration you POST to the API. If you attempt to post invalid JSON, the helper scripts will return an error message. If this occurs, you can use tools such as JSONLint to narrow down the source of the problem and\/or JSON String Escape to learn how to properly escape your text. The LDAP feature does not attempt any ongoing “sync” back from the Sysdig platform user database to the directory server. Note how this impacts the following: If a user is deleted from the directory server, their user record will remain in the Sysdig user database until a Sysdig Admin deletes it. Of course, that user will not be able to login since they will no longer be able to authenticate successfully via LDAP. If an Admin deletes a user from the Sysdig user database, but the user can still authenticate successfully via LDAP, their Sysdig user record will be recreated if they login again via LDAP. If a person’s username should change in the directory server (e.g. the value for sAMAccountName in our examples above), the next time they login, a new user record will be created for them in the Sysdig user database. Settings they previously had in the Sysdig platform such as Admin rights and Alerts\/Dashboard configurations will not be present for this recreated user. Other LDAP-centric functionality that is not currently supported (not an exhaustive list): Mapping a user in the directory server to the Sysdig \"super\" Admin (such as to avoid the need to configure the this \"super\" Admin user). Session expiry based on configuration in the directory server (such as to set a user account to only be valid until a certain date). Login policies based on configuration in the directory server (such as to restrict login to certain hours). User timeout functionality (such as to remove a user from the Sysdig user database if they have not logged in for a certain amount of time). " },

When the LDAP feature is in use, the user’s directory password is not stored in the Sysdig user database. Once LDAP authentication is enabled, all normal user authentication will be performed against your configured directory server. Other local, non-LDAP users that were created before LDAP was enabled can still authenticate via LDAP as long as their username in your directory matches with the the username of their pre-existing record in the Sysdig user database. For example, consider a user jdoe@example.com who had been a user in the Sysdig environment before LDAP was enabled. Once LDAP authentication is enabled, if a user jdoe exists in the directory server and is able to authenticate successfully via LDAP, they will be permitted to log in to the Sysdig platform as the pre-existing jdoe@example.com user. Any user-specific configuration (Alerts, Dashboards, etc.) that were attached to jdoe@example.com will still be visible to this user. Any password previously set for such a pre-existing user record will not be used for authentication to the Sysdig platform unless LDAP authentication is disabled. " },

Creation of this user is a required initial install step either via the Replicated console (see screenshot below) or Kubernetes ConfigMap element sysdigcloud.default.user . This user is required and cannot be deleted. This login provides: A way to access the Sysdig platform when LDAP connectivity is severed. The first Admin user in the install, essential for assigning Admin rights to other users once they’ve authenticated via your directory and their user records have been added to the Sysdig user database. The user whose REST API Token can be used to perform further LDAP configurations via the Sysdig platform API (see below ). Once other directory-authenticated users have been promoted to Admins, those Admins can promote other directory-authenticated users to Admin, and so on. Configuration of Base LDAP Settings The configuration of the LDAP feature can be viewed, updated, and deleted by the \"super\" Admin via the API endpoint \/api\/admin\/ldap\/settings using HTTP methods for GET , POST , and DELETE , respectively. NOTE : See the REST API page for general info on the API, and the the Locating the \"Super\" Admin User page for guidance on finding the token for the appropriate \"super\" Admin user. A version of a login_config.sh helper script is available in a beta branch of the sysdig-cloud-scripts repository for your use along with an example settings_login_simple.json that can be modified for your environment. Refer to the tables below for details on config options. Example command-lines below the table describe how to enable LDAP with these settings. The follow settings are in the required loginConnectionSettings section. Setting Required Description server Yes URL of the directory server for the Sysdig platform to query. An example for LDAP over SSL: ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:636 For cleartext LDAP: ldap:\/\/176.16.0.1 Note that to use LDAPS, you'll also need to use the Replicated console (or equivalent approach in Kubernetes-based installs ) to upload a Certificate Authority (CA) PEM-format certificate that the Sysdig platform will use to validate its SSL connection to the server. If you have a host with OpenSSL tools installed that can reach the directory server, you can obtain the certificate by running: \n# openssl s_client -showcerts -connect <server-ip>:636 The command output will typically show the server certificate first and the CA certificate second, both in PEM format. Into a text file, paste the CA certificate portion of the output that looks like: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n[random text...]\n-----END CERTIFICATE----- Under LDAP CA certificate in the PEM format in the Replicated console, click the \"Choose File\" button and browse to the file you just created to select and upload it. Note that when you click Save , the Sysdig platform will restart. This is the only setting related to LDAP that requires a platform restart. Note: For environments using self-signed certificates, the openssl command shown above will return only one certificate. managerDn Yes The distinguished name of a user that the Sysdig platform can authenticate as via LDAP in order to perform further queries about the users attempting to login to the Sysdig platform. Example: \ncn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local This setting is required, as the Sysdig platform does not support connection to servers via anonymous bind. managerPassword Yes The password for the managerDn . rootDn No The distinguished name for the point in the LDAP tree below which all search queries will begin. Example: dc=example,dc=local referral No Defines whether the Sysdig platform will chase referrals found in LDAP query responses. If not specified, this will be set to \"IGNORE\" in your configuration and referrals will not be chased. See the section below on Multi-Server Directories for more details on this option. The following settings are in the optional loginFilter section:s Setting Required Description searchBase Yes A relative distinguished name (from the rootDn ) below which queries about users should be performed. Example: cn=Users If specified as an empty string ( \"\" ), the search will be performed across everything below the rootDn , in which case the rootDn setting must be configured. Note that if the rootDn setting was not specified, the searchBase setting must provide a full distinguished name. Example: cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local searchFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use in constructing the query to identify the user record. The marker token {0} represents where the username will appear when LDAP queries are constructed. An example that targets the attribute sAMAccountName in Active Directory: \n(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0})) While this setting is optional, if not specified, no users will be able to authenticate via LDAP. To use the helper script, modify the env.sh to set the required values for API_TOKEN and URL for your environment. Once set, invoking login_config.sh with no options will print the current configuration. If you were running Sysdig platform version 858 or older and have just upgraded to version 1149 or newer, you will see your migrated settings. Otherwise, the LDAP feature will start out disabled ( \"enableLdapAuthentication\": false ) and other configuration settings will not be shown. # .\/login_config.sh\n{\n \"ldapSettings\": {\n \"enableLdapAuthentication\": false,\n \"version\": 1\n }\n} Using the guidance in the settings table above, modify the settings_login_simple.json as necessary to allow for connectivity and querying of users in your directory server. To apply the new LDAP settings, invoke login_config.sh with the -s option and specify the filename containing the JSON config, . If successful, the applied configuration will be echoed back by the API. # .\/login_config.sh -s settings_login_simple.json\n{\"ldapSettings\":{\"version\":2,\"loginConnectionSettings\":{\"server\":\"ldap:\/\/172.16.0.1\",\"rootDn\":\"dc=example,dc=local\",\"managerDn\":\"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\",\"managerPassword\":\"myMgrPassword\",\"referral\":\"IGNORE\"},\"loginFilter\":{\"searchBase\":\"cn=Users\",\"searchFilter\":\"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\"},\"enableLdapAuthentication\":true}} Using the specific example settings_login_simple.json and the minimal Active Directory configuration in the screenshot below, login to the Sysdig platform would now be permitted for a user jdoe that has distinguishedName : CN=John Doe,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local To delete LDAP settings, invoke login_config.sh with the -d option.

"body" : "The LDAP feature as it existed in version 858 and earlier included optional additional settings that, when specified, ensured that authenticated users were also members of one or more groups before permitting them to login to the Sysdig platform. These settings are documented here for the benefit of those who used these settings in the past and have had their settings migrated to the newer API-based configuration, where they become part of the loginFilter section. See below for details on how to use the searchFilter instead to achieve equivalent functionality. For use with the login_config.sh helper script, an example settings_login_group_deprecated.json is provided that can be modified for your environment based on the table below. Example command-lines are shown below the table. Setting Required Description groupSearchBase No A relative distinguished name (from the rootDn ) below which queries about groups should be performed. Example: ou=Planets groupSearchFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use in constructing the query to identify a group to which the user must belong. An example that only permits users that are in the Mars group in Active Directory: (&(cn=Mars)(objectclass=group)) If this setting is left blank, group membership is not required, and hence any user that successfully authenticates via LDAP using only username\/password will be permitted to login to the Sysdig platform. groupMembershipFilter No An LDAP search filter (in RFC2254 format) that the Sysdig platform will use to determine group membership. If no setting is specified, the following default filter is applied, which should work for most environments: \n(| (member={0}) (uniqueMember={0}) (memberUid={1})) Using the specific example settings_login_group_deprecated.json and the minimal Active Directory configuration in the screenshot below, login to the Sysdig platform would be permitted for this user who belongs to the Mars group. But our jdoe user who is not a member would be prevented from logging in. To simplify your configuration and avoid use of these deprecated options, an equivalent configuration can be achieved by making the group membership part of the searchFilter : \n\"searchFilter\": \"(&(memberOf=CN=Mars,OU=Planets,DC=example,DC=local)(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\" See the example settings_login_group.json for an updated configuration that can be compared side-by-side with settings_login_group_deprecated.json .

"body" : "Data about your users that need to access the Sysdig platform may be stored across many directory servers in your environment. As the Sysdig platform is only able to query one LDAP server endpoint, you would need to take extra steps to ensure successful authentication for such users. The simplest approach to achieve this is to query against a Global Catalog . As the Global Catalog stores a copy of all Active Directory objects in a forest, this provides a fast and convenient target for the Sysdig platform to find all users that may need to authenticate. Since queries against the Global Catalog are also performed via LDAP, you simply need to ensure your LDAP configuration specifies the appropriate address and TCP port for the Global Catalog, e.g. ldap:\/\/176.16.0.1:3268 for cleartext LDAP or ldaps:\/\/172.16.0.1:3269 for LDAP over SSL. If querying against a Global Catalog, the referral option of the Sysdig platform's LDAP configuration can remain at its default setting of \"IGNORE\" . If a Global Catalog is not available, another approach is to leverage referral chasing . Such chasing depends on complex interplay of configuration settings, DNS resolution, and network connectivity to multiple servers. If you require this option, carefully read the tips in this section and validate your configuration in a test environment before attempting its use in production. Contact Sysdig support for assistance as necessary. For our example configuration, we've added another Domain Controller to our environment that holds users a separate set of users for the child domain eu.example.local . We'd like to permit login for a user \" eurodude \" in the child domain. This user has distinguishedName : \nCN=Euro Dude,CN=Users,DC=eu,DC=example,DC=local In the example configuration settings_login_referral_follow.json shown below, the Sysdig platform still begins its LDAP queries at the same top-level server target. However, the referral option is set to \"FOLLOW\" , which will cause the Sysdig platform to perform subsequent queries if a query returns one or more referrals. {\n \"loginConnectionSettings\": {\n \"server\": \"ldap:\/\/172.16.0.1\",\n \"managerDn\": \"cn=Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"managerPassword\": \"myMgrPassword\",\n \"referral\": \"FOLLOW\"\n },\n \"loginFilter\": {\n \"searchBase\": \"dc=example,dc=local\",\n \"searchFilter\": \"(&(objectClass=organizationalPerson)(sAMAccountName={0}))\"\n },\n \"enableLdapAuthentication\": true\n} Note also how in this case the rootDn option is left unspecified and the searchBase is set to the distinguished name of the top-level domain. This is necessary to ensure the scope of the chased referral queries will include the child domain. If rootDn and searchBase had been left as they were set in the settings_login_simple.json example, the initial query would have been targeted only within cn=Users,dc=example,dc=local and hence the referral would never have been returned by the top-level server. Note these other caveats of referral chasing in the Sysdig platform: Referrals may only be successfully chased to child domains. If referrals point to parallel domains (e.g. for our example, dc=adjacent,dc=local ) the queries will not succeed and users stored in the directory servers for such domains will not be able to authenticate. The LDAP library used by the Sysdig platform does not log information about each referral it attempts to chase. Therefore, if you enable referral chasing, it is important that you understand the server targets that may be chased in your environment and ensure the network connectivity (routing\/firewalls) will permit the Sysdig platform to query these server targets. If LDAP queries are failing due to a network connectivity issue, this will typically be accompanied by delays during Sysdig user logins of approximately 30 seconds followed by a login failure with an HTTP 504 error message shown in the login screen. If this occurs, contact Sysdig support for assistance. " },

"body" : "The default behavior of the LDAP feature is to create a new record in the Sysdig user database when a user authenticates successfully via LDAP for the first time. However, it may be desirable to add such user records in advance of their first login, such as if you wish to use automation to change user permissions, assign team membership, or pre-populate Dashboard\/Alert configurations. A create_user.sh helper script is available in the sysdig-cloud-scripts repository to create such user records via the API. This script can also be used to enable\/disable this functionality in the Sysdig platform. See the README for details. Additional details regarding this type of user creation in conjunction with LDAP authentication: This method allows creation of any username, even if it doesn't currently exist in the directory that is queried via LDAP. When LDAP authentication is enabled, such users can be created with a simple username (e.g. jdoe ) or with an email-style postfix (as is typical for non-LDAP Sysdig user, e.g. jdoe@example.com ). In this latter case only the username portion ( jdoe ) is used when the Sysdig platform is performing an LDAP query during attempted login. While the password must be included in the config you POST to create the user, it is not used by the Sysdig platform when LDAP is enabled, as authentication will always be performed via LDAP. For this same reason, if a user has been created in this way, they will not be able to login unless there is a matching user in the directory that is queried via LDAP. The firstName and lastName values as specified in the example are optional and independent from any equivalent name settings in the directory that is queried via LDAP. " },

"body" : "LDAP support has been tested with Active Directory in Windows Server 2012 R2. It may work with AD versions that ship with other versions of Windows, or other directory servers that use the LDAP protocol. If you are intending to use LDAP with something other than Active Directory, please contact Sysdig Support. The LDAP feature is only present in Sysdig software platform installs (not the SaaS version). Only one LDAP config can exist per deployment (i.e. the platform can only query one directory server endpoint). Because the Sysdig software platform is based on the same technology as the SaaS-based Sysdig service, it theoretically supports the configuration of multiple “customers” using the same install. However, the multi-customer option is not supported when the LDAP feature is enabled. When LDAP authentication is enabled, adding users via email \"invites\" is not possible. LDAP authentication for directory usernames that begin or end with a space character (e.g. \" jdoe\" or \"jdoe \" ) are not supported. Configuration entries that contain special characters (for instance, a managerPassword that contains a backslash character) are supported, but note that you will need to perform proper JSON escaping in the configuration you POST to the API. If you attempt to post invalid JSON, the helper scripts will return an error message. If this occurs, you can use tools such as JSONLint to narrow down the source of the problem and\/or JSON String Escape to learn how to properly escape your text. The LDAP feature does not attempt any ongoing “sync” back from the Sysdig platform user database to the directory server. Note how this impacts the following: If a user is deleted from the directory server, their user record will remain in the Sysdig user database until a Sysdig Admin deletes it. Of course, that user will not be able to login since they will no longer be able to authenticate successfully via LDAP. If an Admin deletes a user from the Sysdig user database, but the user can still authenticate successfully via LDAP, their Sysdig user record will be recreated if they login again via LDAP. If a person’s username should change in the directory server (e.g. the value for sAMAccountName in our examples above), the next time they login, a new user record will be created for them in the Sysdig user database. Settings they previously had in the Sysdig platform such as Admin rights and Alerts\/Dashboard configurations will not be present for this recreated user. Other LDAP-centric functionality that is not currently supported (not an exhaustive list): Mapping a user in the directory server to the Sysdig \"super\" Admin (such as to avoid the need to configure the this \"super\" Admin user). Session expiry based on configuration in the directory server (such as to set a user account to only be valid until a certain date). Login policies based on configuration in the directory server (such as to restrict login to certain hours). User timeout functionality (such as to remove a user from the Sysdig user database if they have not logged in for a certain amount of time). " },

If the hosts in your environment match the kernel versions included with the agent, no special action is needed. In some cases, the host(s) in your environment may use Unix versions that do not match the provided headers, and the agent may fail to install correctly. In those cases, you must install the kernel headers manually. See About Kernel Headers and the Kernel Module for details. Run any commands as root or with the sudo command.

"body" : "Independent of the Auto-Config feature, typical Agent configuration lives in \/opt\/draios\/etc and is derived from a combination of base config in the dragent.default.yaml file and any overrides that may be present in dragent.yaml . See also Understanding the Agent Config Files . Agent Auto-Config adds a middle layer of possible overrides in an additional file dragent.auto.yaml .When present, the the order of config application from highest precedence to lowest now becomes: dragent.yaml dragent.auto.yaml dragent.default.yaml While all Agents are by default prepared to receive and make use of Auto-Config data, the file dragent.auto.yaml will not be present on an Agent until you've pushed central Auto-Config data to be applied to that Agent. Auto-Config settings are performed via Sysdig Monitor's REST API . Simplified examples are available that use the Python client library to get or set current Auto-Config settings. Detailed examples using the REST API are shown below. The REST endpoint for Auto-Config is \/api\/agents\/config . Use the GET method to review the current configuration. The following example shows the initial empty settings that result in no dragent.auto.yaml files being present on your Agents. curl -X GET \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config\n \n \nOutput:\n{\n \"files\": []\n} Use the PUT method to centrally push YAML that will be distributed and applied to your Agents as dragent.auto.yaml files. The content parameter must contain syntactically-correct YAML. The filter option is used to specify if the config should be sent to one agent or all of them, such as in this example to globally enable Debug logging on all Agents: curl -X PUT \\\n --header \"Content-Type: application\/json\" \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config -d '\n{\n \"files\": [\n {\n \"filter\": \"*\",\n \"content\": \"log:\\n console_priority: debug\"\n }\n ]\n}' Alternatively, the filter can specify a hardware MAC address for a single Agent that should receive a certain YAML config. All MAC-specific configs should appear at the top of the JSON object and are not additive to any global Auto-Config specified with \"filter\": \"*\" at the bottom. For example, when the following config is applied, the one Agent that has the MySQL Application Check configured would not have Debug logging enabled, but all others would. curl -X PUT \\\n --header \"Content-Type: application\/json\" \\\n --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/agents\/config -d '\n{\n \"files\": [\n {\n \"filter\": \"host.mac = \\\"08:00:27:de:5b:b9\\\"\",\n \"content\": \"app_checks:\\n - name: mysql\\n pattern:\\n comm: mysqld\\n conf:\\n server: 127.0.0.1\\n user: sysdig-cloud\\n pass: sysdig-cloud-password\"\n },\n {\n \"filter\": \"*\",\n \"content\": \"log:\\n console_priority: debug\"\n }\n ]\n}' To update the active central Auto-Config settings, simply PUT a complete replacement JSON object. All connected Agents will receive centrally-pushed Auto-Config updates that apply to them based on the filter settings. Any Agent whose Auto-Config is enabled\/disabled\/changed based on the centrally-pushed settings will immediately restart, putting the new configuration into effect. Any central Auto-Config settings that would result in a particular Agent's Auto-Config remaining the same will not trigger a restart. " },

There are different team roles, each of which has read\/write access to different aspects of the app. This limits the exposure of data to those who actually need it, and also makes users more productive by focusing them on data that is relevant to them. The following are some potential use cases for Teams: \"Dev\" vs \"Prod\": Many organizations prefer to limit access to production data. Permits isolating physical infrastructure and the applications on top. Microservices: Scoping data for individual dev teams to see their own dashboards and field their own alerts. Permits team creation based on logical isolation using orchestration or config management metadata. Platform as a Service: Where Ops teams need to see the entire platform. Enabling certain people to see all data for all services as well as the underlying hardware. This is perfect for managed service providers who are managing a multi-tenant environment, or devops teams using a similar model within their own organization. Restricted environments: Limiting data access for security and compliance. Certain services, such as authentication and billing, may have a very specific set of individuals authorized to access them. Organizations that need to segment monitoring for efficiency: Wide-ranging use case from very large organizations forming teams to simplify access, to smaller orgs creating ephemeral troubleshooting teams, to teams formed to optimize QA and Support access to system data.

E.g if you purchase 100 licenses, you can install 100 agents, potentially divided between Reserved and On-Demand agents. In AWS, it also determines the number of AWS objects that can be viewed in the Sysdig Monitor Dashboards (unrelated to the number of agents actually installed). In other words, if you have 100 licenses purchased, you can only see 100 AWS objects per region, per service type. See AWS Services Licensing for details. To see how many licenses (and therefore object views) are permitted in your AWS environment, check the Settings >Subscription page. To get an accurate view of which hosts have agents installed, apply the Agent Summary dashboard, using the smallest time interval allowed (to avoid seeing historical data). " },

This means you can install Sysdig agents onto any number of instances. However, only the licensed number of agents will be allowed to connect and send metrics for recording and reporting. Agents connect on a \"first-come, first-served\" basis and in the event of an over-subscription (more agents wanting to communicate than are licensed) they will attempt to reconnect on a periodic basis. Once an existing communicating instance goes down and disconnects, the next agent attempting to connect will be allowed in.

If your system changes external IP addresses, or if you shut down a VM image and bring it back up elsewhere, this will remain the same agent connection. However, identical installs that are simultaneously sending data (usually an accident) will be considered two connections. A MAC address is used to identify a host for licensing purposes. Time Lag for License Release: When shutting down a host for any reason, the agent's license will not be immediately released. This permits the agent to retain its licensing slot for short outages or a reboot. The time-out interval can take up to 20 minutes, and if the connection has not been re-established within the interval the license will be released for use by the next host waiting to connect. " },

Add a Relying Party Trust configuration for the Sysdig application Right-click to Relying Party Trusts > Add Relying Party Trust and click Start to begin the wizard. In the Select Data Source step, click the button to Enter data about the relying party manually , then click Next Enter a Display name of your choosing (e.g. \"Sysdig Monitor\" or \"Sysdig Secure\"), then click Next Click Next to accept the default option to use AD FS profile Click Next to skip the selection of an optional token encryption certificate (Sysdig does not support this option) Check the box to Enable support for the SAML 2.0 Web SSO protocol , then enter one of the following values for Relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URL : If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter: https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com\/api\/saml\/auth If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter: https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com\/api\/saml\/secureAuth Then click Next.

The default to Permit all users to access the relying party will typically be acceptable. Click Next . Review the summary and click Next to complete the configuration of the Relying Party Trust The next step will involve adding Claim Rules, so you can leave the box checked to Open the Edit Claim Rules dialog and click the Close button to be brought immediately into the Claim Rules editor Next we'll use Claim Rules to ensure that login data is sent as needed to the Sysdig platform. A user's login to the Sysdig platform is based on an email address, and a default ADFS configuration would not send the email address as required. The following configuration ensures the correct field from Active Directory is delivered in the claim. If not already in the Claim Rules editor from the previous step, navigate to it by right-clicking on the Relying Party Trust that was just created and selecting Edit Claim Rules Click Add Rule . At the following screen, accept the default rule template to Send LDAP Attributes as Claims and click Next . Enter a name for the rule, select Active Directory as the Attribute store , then use the pull-down selectors to pick E-Mail Address as both the LDAP Attribute and Outgoing Claim Type , then similarly make pull-down selections for Given Name and Surname . Once these selections are made, click Finish . Now click Add Rule again, this time selecting the template for Transform an incoming claim Enter a name for the rule, then use the pull-downs to select an Incoming claim type of E-Mail Address , an Outgoing claim type of Name ID , and an Outgoing name ID format of Email , then click Finish . (Optional) If you want the user's First Name and Last Name to be included in the records created in the Sysdig platform database when new users successfully login via SAML for the first time, additional Transform rules must also be created. Only the email-based username is strictly required and we already created a rule for this, so this step is optional. If you wish to do this, click Add Rule and once again select the template for Transform an incoming claim . Enter a name for the rule, then use the pull-down to select an Incoming claim type of Given Name , and for the Outgoing claim type , directly type first name into the field. After clicking Finish , click Add Rule and create a similar rule to transform the Incoming claim type of Surname to the Outgoing claim type of last name . Having clicked Finish after creating your last rule, you will see all rules now in the editor. You can click Ok , and your ADFS configuration for your Sysdig application is complete. It can be tested once Sysdig Support has completed their side of the configuration using the metadata URL you send in your Support request. " },

"body" : "(Optional) The steps above represent a Service-Provider-Initiated SAML configuration. If you would prefer an IdP-initiated SAML configuration, this is also possible with ADFS, but requires the additional steps described below. The Sysdig platform requires a specific setting of RelayState in order to accept IdP-initiated login flows. On the ADFS versions tested, we've found this use of RelayState is disabled by default, and a Microsoft article describes the topic in detail. To enable it, as described in a Microsoft forum thread , on your ADFS host, edit %systemroot%\\ADFS\\Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost.exe.config and add <useRelayStateForIdpInitiatedSignOn enabled=\"true\" \/> to the <microsoft.identityserver.web> section. Once the modification is saved, restart ADFS services for the change to take effect. You will need to retrieve your Sysdig customer number as described in the Find Your Customer Number article. You will then need to generate an IdP-initiated login URL. In addition to having the correct settings, it must be properly URL encoded. To ease this configuration, use this ADFS RelayState Generator tool. When launched, enter the values below, then hit the Generate URL button. For the IDP URL String , enter https:\/\/YOUR_ADFS_SERVER\/adfs\/ls\/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx For the Relying Party Identifier , enter one of the following values: If configuring Sysdig Monitor, enter https:\/\/app.sysdigcloud.com If configuring Sysdig Secure, enter https:\/\/secure.sysdig.com For the Relay State\/Target App , enter #\/&customer=CUSTOMER-ID-NUMBER , substituting the CUSTOMER-ID-NUMBER you retrieved in the previous step This Results URL will be used in the metadata URL that you paste in the Metadata entry in the SAML connection settings . Use the Results URL from the tool to test your IdP-initiated login. Note that per this Microsoft forum thread , it is apparently not possible to configure ADFS to use such a URL when your users select the application from the pull-down menu at https:\/\/YOUR_ADFS_SERVER\/adfs\/ls\/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx . However, you may embed the URL into a custom portal or bookmarks list. Now you can test login using an Active Directory user that has an Email address configured. " },

"body" : "The Sysdig Monitor Agent uses its visibility to all running processes (at both the host and container levels) to find eligible targets for scraping Prometheus metrics. By default, no scraping is attempted. Once the feature is enabled, the Agent assembles a list of eligible targets in two steps: A process is determined to be eligible for possible scraping if it positively matches against a series of Process Filter include\/exclude rules. The Agent will then attempt to scrape an eligible process at a \/metrics endpoint on all of its listening TCP ports, unless the additional configuration is present to restrict scraping to a subset of ports and\/or another endpoint name. The metrics ultimately appear in the Sysdig Monitor Explore interface in the Prometheus section. Within the set of eligible processes\/ports\/endpoints, the Agent uses an auto-discover approach to scrape only ports that are exporting Prometheus metrics, and will stop attempting to scrape or retry on ports based on how they respond to attempts to connect and scrape them. It is therefore strongly recommended that you create a configuration that restricts the process and ports for attempted scraping to the minimum expected range for your exporters. This minimizes the potential for unintended side-effects in both the Agent and your applications due to repeated failed connection attempts. " },

Such environments can quickly begin scraping the same metrics using the Sysdig Agent in a couple easy steps. Enable the Prometheus metrics feature in the Sysdig Agent. Assuming you are deploying using DaemonSets , the needed config can be added to the Agent's dragent.yaml by including the following in your DaemonSet YAML (placing it in the env section for the sysdig-agent container): - name: ADDITIONAL_CONF\n value: \"prometheus:\\n enabled: true\"\n\n Ensure the Kubernetes Pods that contain your Prometheus exporters have been deployed with the following Annotations to enable scraping (substituting the listening exporter-TCP-port) : spec:\n template:\n metadata:\n annotations:\n prometheus.io\/scrape: \"true\"\n prometheus.io\/port: \"exporter-TCP-port\" The configuration above assumes your exporters use the typical endpoint called \/metrics . If an exporter is using a different endpoint, this can also be specified by adding the following additional optional Annotation, substituting the exporter-endpoint-name : \nprometheus.io\/path: \"\/exporter-endpoint-name\" If you try this Kubernetes Deployment of a simple exporter , you will quickly see auto-discovered Prometheus metrics being displayed in Sysdig Monitor. You can use this working example as a basis to similarly Annotate your own exporters.

"body" : "The process_filter section specifies which of the processes known by an Agent may be eligible for scraping. Note that once you specify a process_filter in your dragent.yaml , this replaces the entire Prometheus process_filter section (i.e. all rules) shown in the dragent.default.yaml . The Process Filter is specified in a series of include and exclude rules that are evaluated top-to-bottom for each process known by an Agent. If a process matches an include rule, scraping will be attempted via a \/metrics endpoint on each listening TCP port for the process, unless a conf section also appears within the rule to further restrict how the process will be scraped (see the \"conf\" section below). Multiple patterns can be specified in a single rule, in which case all patterns must match for the rule to be a match (AND logic). Within a pattern value, simple \"glob\" wildcarding may be used, where * matches any number of characters (including none) and ? matches any single character. Note that due to YAML syntax, when using wildcards, be sure to enclose the value in quotes ( \"*\" ). The table below describes the supported patterns in Process Filter rules. To provide realistic examples, we'll use a simple sample Prometheus exporter (source code here ) which can be deployed as a container using the Docker command line below. To help illustrate some of the configuration options, this sample exporter presents Prometheus metrics on \/promtheus instead of the more common \/metrics endpoint, which will be shown in the example configurations further below. # docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \\\n --label class=\"exporter\" \\\n --name my-java-app \\\n luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n \n# ps auxww | grep app.jar\nroot 11502 95.9 9.2 3745724 753632 ?

Pattern name Description Example container.image Matches if the process is running inside a container running the specified image - include: container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app container.name Matches if the process is running inside a container with the specified name - include: container.name : my-java-app container.label.* Matches if the process is running in a container that has a Label matching the given value - include: container.label.class: exporter kubernetes.<object>.annotation.* kubernetes.<object>.label.* Matches if the process is attached to a Kubernetes object (Pod, Namespace, etc.) that is marked with the Annotation\/Label matching the given value. Note: This pattern does not apply to the Docker-only command-line shown above, but would instead apply if the exporter were installed as a Kubernetes Deployment using this example YAML . Note: See the section below on Integrate Prometheus Metrics into Sysdig Monitor UI#Kubernetes Objects for information on the full set of supported Annotations and Labels. - include: kubernetes.pod.annotation.prometheus.io\/scrape : true process.name Matches the name of the running process - include: process.name : java process.cmdline Matches a command line argument - include: process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\" port Matches if the process is listening on one or more TCP ports. The pattern for a single rule can specify a single port as shown in this example, or a single range (e.g. 8079-8081 ), but does not support comma-separated lists of ports\/ranges. Note: This parameter is only used to confirm if a process is eligible for scraping based on the ports on which it is listening. For example, if a process is listening on one port for application traffic and has a second port open for exporting Prometheus metrics, it would be possible to specify the application port here (but not the exporting port), and the exporting port in the conf section (but not the application port), and the process would be matched as eligible and the exporting port would be scraped. - include: port: 8080 appcheck.match Matches if an Application Check with the specific name or pattern is scheduled to run for the process. - exclude: appcheck.match: \"*\" Instead of the include examples shown above that would have each matched our process, due to the previously-described ability to combine multiple patterns in a single rule, the following very strict configuration would also have matched: - include:\n container.image: luca3m\/prometheus-java-app\n container.name: my-java-app\n container.label.class: exporter\n process.name: java\n process.cmdline: \"*app.jar*\"\n port: 8080 " },

To enable the entire config shown here, you would only need to add the following to your dragent.yaml : prometheus:\n enabled: true A Process Filter rule excludes processes that are likely to exist in most environments but are known to never export Prometheus metrics, such as the Docker Proxy and the Agent itself. Another Process Filter rule ensures that any processes configured to be scraped by the legacy Prometheus Application Check will not be scraped. See the section below on the Legacy Prometheus Application Check for details. Another Process Filter rule is tailored to use of container Labels. Processes marked with the container Label io.prometheus.scrape will become eligible for scraping, and if further marked with container Labels io.prometheus.port and\/or io.prometheus.path , scraping will be attempted only on this port and\/or endpoint. If the container is not marked with the specified path Label, scraping the \/metrics endpoint will be attempted. If the container is not marked with the specified port Label, any listening ports in the port_filter will be attempted for scraping (this port_filter in the default is set for the range of ports for common Prometheus exporters , with exclusions for ports in the range that are known to be used by other applications that are not exporters). The final Process Filter include rule is tailored to the use case described above in Quick Start For Kubernetes Environments . " },

"body" : "Multiple Agents can share the same configuration. Therefore, determine which one of those Agents scrape the remote endpoints with the dragent.yaml file. This is applicable to both Create a separate configuration section for remote services in the Agent configuration file under the prometheus configuration. Include a configuration section for each remote endpoint, and add either a URL or host\/port (and an optional path) parameter to each section to identify the endpoint to scrape. The optional path identifies the resource at the endpoint. An empty path parameter defaults to the \"\/metrics\" endpoint for scraping. Optionally, add custom tags for each endpoint configuration for remote services. In the absence of tags, metric reporting might not work as expected when multiple endpoints are involved. Agents cannot distinguish similar metrics scraped from multiple endpoints unless those metrics are uniquely identified by tags. To help you get started, an example configuration for Kubernetes is given below: prometheus:\n remote_services:\n - prom_1:\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/region: europe\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/scraper: true\n conf:\n url: \"https:\/\/xx.xxx.xxx.xy:5005\/metrics\"\n tags:\n host: xx.xxx.xxx.xy\n service: prom_1\n scraping_node: \"{kubernetes.node.name}\"\n - prom_2:\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/region: india\n kubernetes.node.annotation.sysdig.com\/scraper: true\n conf:\n host: xx.xxx.xxx.yx\n port: 5005\n use_https: true\n tags:\n host: xx.xxx.xxx.yx\n service: prom_2\n scraping_node: \"{kubernetes.node.name}\"\n - prom_3:\n kubernetes.pod.annotation.sysdig.com\/prom_3_scraper: true\n conf:\n url: \"{kubernetes.pod.annotation.sysdig.com\/prom_3_url}\"\n tags:\n service: prom_3\n scraping_node: \"{kubernetes.node.name}\"\n - haproxy:\n kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_scraper: true\n conf:\n host: \"mymasternode\"\n port: 1936\n path: \"\/metrics\"\n username: \"{kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_username}\"\n password: \"{kubernetes.node.annotation.yourhost.com\/haproxy_password}\"\n tags:\n service: router In the above example, scraping is triggered by node and pod annotations.

For example, this is the Tomcat section: per_process_beans:\n tomcat:\n pattern: \"catalina\"\n beans:\n - query: \"Catalina:type=Cache,*\"\n attributes:\n - accessCount\n - cacheSize\n - hitsCount\n - . . . The key name, tomcat in this case, will be displayed as a process name in the Sysdig Monitor user interface instead of just java . The pattern: parameter specifies a string that is used to match a java process name and arguments with this set of JMX metrics. If the process main class full name contains the given text, the process is tagged and the metrics specified in the section will be fetched. The class names are matched against the process argument list. If you implement JMX metrics in a custom manner that does not expose the class names on the command line, you will need to find a pattern which conveniently matches your java invocation command line. The beans: section contains the list of beans to be queried, based on JMX patterns. JMX patterns are explained in details in the Oracle documentation , but in practice, the format of the query line is pretty simple: you can specify the full name of the bean like java.lang:type=Memory , or you can fetch multiple beans in a single line using the wildcard * as in: java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,* To get the list of all the beans that your application exports, you can use JVisualVM , Jmxterm , JConsole or other similar tools. Here is a screenshot from JConsole showing where to find the namespace, bean and attribute (metric) information (JConsole is available when you install the Java Development Kit): For each query, you can specify the attributes that you want to retrieve. We support the following JMX attributes (For these attributes, all the subattributes will be retrieved): Numeric CompositeDataSupport Attributes may be absolute values or rates. For values, we need to calculate a per second rate before sending them. In this case, you can specify type: counter , the default is rate which can be omitted, so usually you can simply write the attribute name. " },

"body" : "In infrastructures already containing a third party StatsD collection server, StatsD metrics can be collected \"out of band\". A passive collection technique is automatically performed by our agent by intercepting system calls - as is done for all the Sysdig Monitor metrics normally collected. This method does not require changing your current StatsD configuration and is an excellent way to 'test drive' the Sysdig Monitor application without having to perform any modifications other than agent installation. The passive mode of collection is especially suitable for containerized environments where simplicity and efficiency are essential. With the containerized version of the Sysdig Monitor agent running on the host, all other container applications can continue to transmit to any currently implemented collector. In the case where no collector exists, container applications can simply be configured to send StatsD metrics to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1) as demonstrated above - no actual StatsD server needs to be listening at that address. Effectively, each network transmission made from inside the application container, including statsd messages sent to a non existent destination, generates a system call. The Sysdig agent captures these system calls from its own container, where the statsd collector is listening. In practice, the Sysdig agent acts as a transparent proxy between the application and the StatsD collector, even if they are in different containers. The agent correlates which container a system call is coming from, and uses that information to transparently label the StatsD messages. The above graphic demonstrates the components of the Sysdig agent and where metrics are actively or passively collected. Regardless of the method of collection, the number of StatsD metrics the agent can transmit is limited by your payment plan. Note 1 : When using the passive technique, ICMP port unreachable events may be generated on the host network. Note 2: Some clients may use IPv6 addressing (::1) for the \"localhost\" address string. Metrics collection over IPv6 is not supported at this time. If your StatsD metrics are not visible in the Sysdig Monitor interface, please use \"127.0.0.1\" instead of \"localhost\" string to force IPv4. Another solution that may be required is adding the JVM option: java.net .preferIPv4Stack=true. Note 3 : When StatsD metrics are not continuously transmitted by your application (once per second as in the case of all agent created metrics), the charts will render a 'zero' or null value. Any alert conditions will only look at those Statsd values actually transmitted and ignore the nulls. For more detail on the benefits of Sysdig Monitor's implementation of StatsD, please see the article State of the Art: StatsD Deployment Strategies in Containerized Environments . " },

"body" : "As of Sysdig agent version 0.90.1, a new configuration option permits the agent to reliably receive StatsD metrics from containers, even while the agent is under load. The Sysdig agent automatically parses and records StatsD metrics. Historically, the agent parsed the system call stream from the kernel in order to read and record StatsD metrics from containers. For performance reasons, the agent may not be able to collect all StatsD metrics using this mechanism. (For example, if the StatsD client writes more than 2kB worth of StatsD metrics in a single system call, the agent will truncate the StatsD message, resulting in loss of StatsD metrics.) This change introduces a new configuration option: statsd:\nuse_forwarder: true When set to true , then rather than use the system call stream for container StatsD messages, the agent instead listens for UDP datagrams on the configured StatsD port on the localhost within the container's network namespace. This enables the agent to reliably receive StatsD metrics from containers, even while the agent is under load. This option introduces a behavior change in the agent, both in the destination address and in port settings. Without the option, the agent will read StatsD metrics that are destined to any remote address. With the option set, the agent will receive only metrics addressed to localhost. Without the option, the agent will read container StatsD messages only destined to port 8125. With the option set, the agent will use the configured StatsD port. " },

This setting defaults to GET, though many other HTTP methods are supported, including POST and PUT. data The data option is only available when using the POST method. Data should be included as key-value pairs and will be sent in the body of the request. content_match A string or Python regular expression. The HTTP check will search for this value in the response and will report as DOWN if the string or expression is not found. reverse_content_match When true, reverses the behavior of the content_match option, i.e. the HTTP check will report as DOWN if the string or expression in content_match IS found. (default is false) username & password If your service uses basic authentication, you can provide the username and password here. http_response_status_code A string or Python regular expression for an HTTP status code. This check will report DOWN for any status code that does not match. This defaults to 1xx, 2xx and 3xx HTTP status codes. For example: 401 or 4\\d\\d . include_content When set to true , the check will include the first 200 characters of the HTTP response body in notifications. The default value is false . collect_response_time By default, the check will collect the response time (in seconds) as the metric network.http.response_time . To disable, set this value to false . disable_ssl_validation This setting will skip SSL certificate validation and is enabled by default. If you require SSL certificate validation, set this to false . This option is only used when gathering the response time\/aliveness from the specified endpoint. Note this setting doesn’t apply to the check_certificate_expiration option. ignore_ssl_warning When SSL certificate validation is enabled (see setting above), this setting allows you to disable security warnings. ca_certs This setting allows you to override the default certificate path as specified in init_config check_certificate_expiration When check_certificate_expiration is enabled, the service check will check the expiration date of the SSL certificate. Note that this will cause the SSL certificate to be validated, regardless of the value of the disable_ssl_validation setting. days_warning When check_certificate_expiration is enabled, these settings will raise a warning alert when the SSL certificate is within the specified number of days from expiration. check_hostname When check_certificate_expiration is enabled, this setting will raise a warning if the hostname on the SSL certificate does not match the host of the given URL. headers This parameter allows you to send additional headers with the request. e.g. X-Auth-Token: <AUTH_TOKEN> skip_proxy If set, the check will bypass proxy settings and attempt to reach the check URL directly. This defaults to false . allow_redirects This setting allows the service check to follow HTTP redirects and defaults to true . tags A list of arbitrary tags that will be associated with the check.

The network devices include physical devices like switches, routers, servers etc. SNMP has three primary versions ( SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3) and SNMPv2c is most widely used. SNMP allows device vendors to expose management data in the form of variables on managed systems organized in a management information base (MIB), which describe the system status and configuration. The devices can be queried as well as configured remotely using these variables. Certain MIBs are generic and supported by the majority of the device vendors. Additionally, each vendor can have their own private\/enterprise MIBs for vendor-specific information. SNMP MIB is a collection of objects uniquely identified by an Object Identifier (OID). OIDs are represented in the form of x.0, where x is the name of object in the MIB definition. \nFor example, suppose one wanted to identify an instance of the variable sysDescr \n\nThe object class for sysDescr is: \n\niso org dod internet mgmt mib system sysDescr \n 1 3 6 1 2 1 1 1\n\nHence, the object type, x, would be 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1 " },

Besides metric_name and value parameters that are quite obvious, you can also add tags to your metric using this format: \ntags = [ \"key:value\", \"key2:value2\", \"key_without_value\"] It is an array of string representing tags in both single or key\/value approach. They will be useful in Sysdig Monitor for graph segmentation.

Save and Restore Dashboards with Scripts Sysdig Monitor provides users the ability to save existing dashboards to a locally controlled file, and create new dashboards identical to the ones previously saved. This can be done via Sysdig's Python client library example scripts. The save script stores all current dashboards for the active account in a .zip archive, while the restore script adds all dashboards in the archive to the list of dashboards. Restoring dashboards will not override the user's existing dashboards. Instead, new dashboards will be added to the list. If this script is used in a strictly backup\/restore capacity, dashboards will need to be deleted manually from the account, either before or after the restore action is completed.

Fixed limit\/requests calculations for init containers Fixed memory calculations for Kubernetes init container limits and requests Improved Healthcheck monitoring Agent has improved ability to detect commands identified as a part of Kubernetes Liveness\/Readiness Probes, in addition to Docker Health Checks. Improved error messaging Warning messages for container group inconsistencies were demoted to debug level, as they are harmless and do not need to clutter the error reporting stream. Fixed issue with container \"incomplete\" reporting status Starting with version 0.90.0, the agent would report containers for which it had not yet fetched metadata as \"incomplete.\" This would then propagate to the Monitor UI. This restores the behavior where the agent leaves the unknown fields unset. Resolved REST server issue Fixed problem where an enabled port would respond to HTTP requests when not desired. Fixed issue with StatsD metrics collection Previous versions of the Sysdig agent, when configured to use the StatsD fowarder ( {{statsd.use_forwarder: true}} ) truncated messages that it received from containers to 2048 bytes, resulting in the potential for dropped and corrupted metrics. This change resolves that problem. See details under StatsD Integration . " },

Fix to make agent - backend connection more robust Fixed an issue that occurs when the agent is reconnecting to the collector and then gets restarted. Provide StatsD option to run statsite_forwarder in driver mode The Sysdig agent automatically parses and records StatsD metrics. Historically, the agent parsed the system call stream from the kernel in order to read and record StatsD metrics from containers. For performance reasons, the agent may not be able to collect all StatsD metrics using this mechanism. (For example, if the StatsD client writes more than 2kB worth of StatsD metrics in a single system call, the agent will truncate the StatsD message, resulting in loss of StatsD metrics.) This change introduces a new configuration option: statsd:\n use_forwarder: true When set, this option enables the agent reliably to receive StatsD metrics from containers, even while the agent is under load. See Integrate StatsD Metrics for more detail. net.bytes.* metric bug fix Fixed an issue with the calculation of net.bytes.* metrics under rare conditions when the agent sub-samples Sysdig events.

App checks configuration with SDCheck Fixed an issue to allow single app checks to run SDCheck binary with the runCheck command. This is helpful for configuration and troubleshooting. StatsD truncation issue Specified a port range for increased snapshot length ( snaplen) in the default.dragent.yaml, to work around a StatsD truncation issue. Agent crash issue A bug was causing the agent to crash when restarting if the connection to the backend failed or timed out. This issue has been resolved. Activity timestamps Improved process watchdog to handle potential activity timestamps greater than the current time. App check name in logs Added app check name to log messages. RabbitMQ app check Now using a long-lived connection to RabbitMQ for its app check. Reduce overhead for serialization Reduced overhead of serializing messages sent to the Sysdig backend, including doing the serialization asynchronously. Disallow running some app check integrations with Python 2.6 Will not run the following app checks when using Python 2.6: NGINX Plus, HAProxy, Consul, Kafka, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ SSL certs for RHEL\/CentOS Now uses the correct SSL CA bundle on RHEL\/CentOS systems. Asynchronous fetches Agent performs fetches of container metadata asynchronously. Cointerface handling Gracefully reconnects to the cointerface process when it is restarted, by having a single gRPC connection. Increased cointerface's default watchdog limit to 1GiB. Segmentation improvements Segments file I\/O per file name for programs\/containers, account file I\/O per superblock. Improved Kubernetes node reporting Sysdig Monitor now uses container information instead of IP address information to identify the Kubernetes node. This prevents reporting information for multiple Kubernetes nodes. PV Kube state metrics improvement Ensures that Kube State Metrics are still collected after creating a Persistent Volume. Event processing improvement Improved performance of system call event processing. NULL file handling Fixed a potential crash when extracting file information for NULL files. " },
